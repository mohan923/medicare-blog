      <p><b>At risk for glaucoma? Find out before it’s too late</b></p>
<p>Do you have diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or are you African American and age 50 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher. With the start of a new year, it’s the perfect time to schedule a regular eye exam to check for glaucoma. You can prevent vision loss by finding and treating problems early.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The new year is fast approaching. Here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2013.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2013?</span></b><br />
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment and don’t get your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. </span><a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">2. Did you budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</span></b><br />
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147. Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2013.</span></a></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</span></b><br />
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Medicare covers many </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">preventive services</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;"> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">wellness visit</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;"> and other screenings. You can also use </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</span></b><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">You can make this change once per calendar year. </span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Remember to check </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">www.medicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a healthy 2013.</span></span></p>

<p>With the holiday season upon us, it’s easy to get busy this time of year. Some pretty important tasks can get left to the last minute. One of those important tasks is ensuring you are in the right health insurance plan in Medicare.  Selecting the right plan is a personal choice, and a lot of thoughtful consideration goes into finding the right match.  But just like the holidays, those key dates come whether or not you are ready.</p>
<p>If you haven’t made up your mind yet about a health or drug plan, now is the time to make your selection.  Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7.  To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/your-medicare-coverage.html?q=plan%20finder">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to review the options in your area. It can help you decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meet your needs and budget. </p>
<p>If you’re like <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/mycare/stories.html#helen">Helen Rayon from Philadelphia</a> and find yourself in Medicare’s prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”), you will continue to save money in 2013 with big discounts on brand-name prescription drugs.  More than 5.6 million people like Helen have saved over $5 billion on prescription drugs in the donut hole since 2010.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now is the time to act and cross another item off your to-do list.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you’ve ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer, there’s help. Medicare has a special program called “</span><a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Extra Help</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like </span><span style="color:#000000;">monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan. Did you know that the Extra Help program is estimated to be worth about $4,000 dollars per person, per year? Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see.</span></p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><i>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</i></p>
<p>Like most people, I take comfort in the things I’m familiar with. I choose to shop at the supermarket around the corner because I know exactly where to find the things I’m looking for. Sure, I might be able to save a little more money by shopping at a different store on the other side of town, but I choose to stick with what I’m most comfortable. We all like to get a good deal, but convenience is a big part of the value.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to <span style="color:#000000;">cost</span>, <span style="color:#000000;">coverage</span>, and <span style="color:#000000;">benefits</span>, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options during Open Enrollment:</p>
<p><b>Doctor and hospital choice</b></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Will your doctors and hospitals accept your current coverage next year? If you’re thinking about changing plans, make sure you check which doctors and hospitals you’ll be able to use. Where are they located, and what are their hours?</p>
<p><b>Pharmacy access</b></p>
<p>Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network? Do they <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.</p>
<p><b>Travel</b></p>
<p>Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area. <span style="color:#000000;">If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). </span></p>
