      <p>he start of spring is a reminder of new beginnings – the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health. One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, so taking advantage of them is a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, we cover a “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.</p>

<p>If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a yearly wellness visit to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors. In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, and obesity management, just to name a few. Check out our complete list of Medicare-covered preventive services.</p>

      <p>By Dr. Patrick Conway, CMS Deputy Administrator for Innovation and Quality and Chief Medical Officer.</p>

<p>Today, CMS released the 2015 National Impact Assessment of Quality Measures Report (2015 Impact Report) (http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityMeasures/National-Impact-Assessment-of-the-Centers-for-Medicare-and-Medicaid-Services-CMS-Quality-Measures-Reports.html.). The 2015 Impact Report demonstrates that the nation has made clear progress in improving the healthcare delivery system to achieve the three aims of better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.
This report is a comprehensive assessment of quality measures used by CMS. It examines the effectiveness and impact of measurement and demonstrates our commitment to achieving optimal results from our quality measurement programs. The report summarizes key findings from CMS quality measurement efforts and recommended next steps to improve on these efforts.
Specifically, the report outlines the performance on quality measures over time and improvements achieved. Findings from the report include research on 25 CMS quality programs and hundreds of quality measures from 2006 to 2013 and builds on the prior 2012 Impact Assessment Report. Many of these measures are also included in incentive programs that link payment to quality performance.</p>
