        <description>&lt;p&gt;he start of spring is a reminder of new beginnings – the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health. One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, so taking advantage of them is a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, we cover a “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a yearly wellness visit to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors. In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, and obesity management, just to name a few. Check out our complete list of Medicare-covered preventive services.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CMS announces release of 2015 Impact Assessment of Quality Measures Report</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;By Dr. Patrick Conway, CMS Deputy Administrator for Innovation and Quality and Chief Medical Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, CMS released the 2015 National Impact Assessment of Quality Measures Report (2015 Impact Report) (http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityMeasures/National-Impact-Assessment-of-the-Centers-for-Medicare-and-Medicaid-Services-CMS-Quality-Measures-Reports.html.). The 2015 Impact Report demonstrates that the nation has made clear progress in improving the healthcare delivery system to achieve the three aims of better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.
This report is a comprehensive assessment of quality measures used by CMS. It examines the effectiveness and impact of measurement and demonstrates our commitment to achieving optimal results from our quality measurement programs. The report summarizes key findings from CMS quality measurement efforts and recommended next steps to improve on these efforts.
Specifically, the report outlines the performance on quality measures over time and improvements achieved. Findings from the report include research on 25 CMS quality programs and hundreds of quality measures from 2006 to 2013 and builds on the prior 2012 Impact Assessment Report. Many of these measures are also included in incentive programs that link payment to quality performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This spring, put prevention into practice </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The start of spring is a reminder of new beginnings – the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health. One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, so taking advantage of them is a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, we cover a “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice preventive care so you can you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Valentine’s Day, give yourself the gift of a healthy heart</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; can. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, taking 600,000 lives each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease. Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicare will cover a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html&quot;&gt;cardiovascular screening&lt;/a&gt; at no cost to you every 5 years. The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions. You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February is American Heart month, so start it off right by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://recipes.millionhearts.hhs.gov/&quot;&gt;Million Hearts® Healthy Eating &amp;amp; Lifestyle Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;. Million Hearts is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. The resource center was developed in partnership with &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;magazine. It features lower sodium, heart-healthy recipes and family-friendly meal plans to help manage sodium intake, a major contributor to high blood pressure and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjMfwA4ToVE&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; for more information about the Million Hearts initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Choosing a dialysis facility just got easier</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you the kind of shopper who reads reviews or looks at ratings before you make a purchase? Wouldn’t it be helpful to have the same kind of ratings when choosing a dialysis facility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be overwhelming when you’re faced with having to choose a health care provider. Providers and facilities differ in the safety and quality of care they give, and having quality ratings available to compare providers can help you make more informed health care decisions. That’s why we’ve made it easier to use the information on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/#search&quot;&gt;Dialysis Facility Compare&lt;/a&gt; (DFC) site by adding star ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare websites are the official source for information about the quality of health care providers, and star ratings are just one of many ways we’re working to make quality information easier to understand and compare. These ratings are based on an established and respected process for developing standards. The DFC rating gives a 1 to 5-star rating based on information about the quality of care and services that a dialysis facility provides. Right now, we do this based on 9 quality measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DFC ratings are just one example of how we’re commited to helping you make informed health care decisions. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html&quot;&gt;Nursing Home Compare&lt;/a&gt; site already uses star ratings to help consumers compare nursing homes and choose one based on quality. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/search.html&quot;&gt;Physician Compare&lt;/a&gt; has just started to include star ratings in certain situations for physician group practices. We’re planning on adding star ratings to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html&quot;&gt;Hospital Compare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.html&quot;&gt;Home Health Compare&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Protect yourself – get screened for cervical cancer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know all women are at risk for cervical cancer, and it occurs most often in women over 30? Fortunately, Medicare covers 2 types of screening test – the Pap smear and human papilloma virus (HPV) test – that can help find cancer and other health problems early and improve recovery and survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January is Cervical Health Awareness Month. Watch our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBtnj3N3IMs&quot;&gt;Cervical Health Awareness Month video&lt;/a&gt; and visit our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cervical-vaginal-cancer-screenings.html&quot;&gt;cervical &amp;amp; vaginal cancer screenings&lt;/a&gt; page to learn what these tests do and how often they’re covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nccc-online.org/&quot;&gt;National Cervical Cancer Coalition&lt;/a&gt; website to find ways you can raise awareness about cervical cancer and how you can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Get your Medicare ready for 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you make resolutions for the new year? Here are some easy ones you can keep that will help get you ready for 2015:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Check to see that you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2015.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you change your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment? If you did and you haven’t received your new card or welcome packet by January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html&quot;&gt;find out how to fill a prescription without your card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/&quot;&gt;Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you have Medicare Part B and you’re in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2014. Plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html&quot;&gt;Find out more about Medicare costs in 2015.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  Schedule appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicare covers all sorts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html&quot;&gt;preventive services&lt;/a&gt; to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems, and many are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html&quot;&gt;wellness visit&lt;/a&gt; and other screenings. You can also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mymedicare.gov/&quot;&gt;MyMedicare.gov&lt;/a&gt; to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure your drug or health plan meet your needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make this change once per calendar year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx&quot;&gt;Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to check &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicare.gov/&quot;&gt;www.medicare.gov&lt;/a&gt; for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a happy and healthy new year!&lt;/p&gt;
