  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cross-posed from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/strengthening.html">healthcare.gov</a>:

Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

Millions of Americans rely on Medicare for their health care security.  But for years, skyrocketing health care costs have threatened the long-term financial health of the program.  Many people with Medicare have worried about the long-term solvency of Medicare and whether or not there would be enough funds in the program in the future to pay for care for them and their children.

Thanks to some important new features of the Affordable Care Act, Americans can rest assured that Medicare will continue to be there – <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/now/index.html" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/now/index.html">better than ever</a> – for our seniors and individuals with disabilities.

Today, my agency, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, released a new report, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/docs/ACA-Update-Implementing-Medicare-Costs-Savings.pdf">Affordable Care Act Update: Implementing Medicare Costs Savings</a>, demonstrating just how much – and how fast – important provisions of the <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/strengthening/index.html" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/strengthening/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> will improve the financial health of Medicare.   In 2010 and 2011 alone, these provisions will save Medicare an estimated $8 billion and almost $418 billion by 2019. These savings will protect the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund through 2027, extending its life by 12 years.

These new savings will come largely as a result of reducing excessive payments to private health insurance companies, promoting better quality of care, and cutting Medicare waste and <a title="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/" href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">fraud</a> through powerful new tools. These tools keep bad actors out of the Medicare program in order to prevent fraud in the first place and enhanced technologies to help law enforcement stop fraud quickly when it does occur.

And there are many important investments in support of innovation for clinicians and health care organizations who are trying every day, as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is, to make health care better for patients and more affordable at the same time.

There are other actions in the new law that strengthen Medicare by improving the health of those who receive benefits.  These include improving outreach and coordination efforts after a patient is discharged from the hospital to prevent unnecessary hospital readmissions and reducing preventable surgical errors.

Many of the programs in the Affordable Care Act are designed to ensure that people with Medicare continue to have access to quality, affordable care. This year, many people with Medicare who have fallen into <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/about/provisions/Donut%20Hole/donuthole.html" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/about/provisions/Donut%20Hole/donuthole.html">the Medicare donut hole</a> are receiving a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11464.pdf">one-time $250 rebate check</a> to help with their drug costs, making sure that financial concerns do not interrupt needed treatment agreed on by a patient and a doctor.

And next year, all people with Medicare will have access to <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/pdf/07-14-10_prevention_seniors_fact_sheet.pdf" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/pdf/07-14-10_prevention_seniors_fact_sheet.pdf">annual wellness visits and other preventive services</a> with no cost-sharing, giving millions of Americans an opportunity to get potentially life-saving screenings. Over time, new reforms will also encourage better coordinated care.

Together, this adds up to a good deal for people with Medicare and taxpayers. If you or someone you love is on Medicare, make sure to check out sections like <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/index.html" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/index.html">here</a> and <a title="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/disabilities/havemedicare/index.html" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/disabilities/havemedicare/index.html">here</a> on <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">www.healthcare.gov</a> that talk more about how the Affordable Care Act affects you.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</em>

I am pleased today to bring good news to you about the health and future of Medicare.  As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, the financial outlook for Medicare is substantially improved compared to prior evaluations.  This improvement is not without some important qualifications, but it nonetheless represents a very positive change in the expected operations of the Medicare trust funds.

In 2009, Medicare provided health insurance coverage to 46.3 million people.  Total Medicare expenditures were $509 billion and income was $508 billion.  The average Medicare benefit per enrollee was $11,743.  These Medicare expenditures were slightly lower than estimated in last year’s Trustees Report.  Within the total, Part A and Part D spending were each slightly lower than estimated, while Part B outlays were slightly higher. Medicare expenditures in 2009 represented 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product.  Last year, these costs were projected to increase steadily (and rapidly) to over 11 percent of GDP by the end of the long-range, 75-year projection period.  In the new report, based on the cost-containment efforts of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare is projected to represent 6.4 percent of GDP in 2084.

Other good news?  The Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to be able to pay all benefits on time until 2029—12 years longer than last year’s estimate of 2017.  And the long-range actuarial deficit for HI is only one-sixth of its prior level—specifically, 0.66 percent of taxable payroll versus 3.88 percent.

These favorable changes depend critically on a specific ACA provision, which will slow the rate of growth in Medicare payments to most categories of providers by about 1.1 percent annually in anticipation of improvement in productivity.  It is important to note that the effect of these adjustments will reduce payment rates over time, and it is possible that providers would not be able to slow their cost growth correspondingly.

However, as someone who has spent my career improving care for patients, I have seen firsthand the substantial improvements in quality and cost-effectiveness that can be achieved by health care providers.  As a result of this provision, providers will have strong financial incentives and many other supports to find more efficient ways to care for patients that not only reduce costs but more importantly improve quality.

Our agency intends to work with providers to support these improvements and carefully monitor the impact of this provision on access to high quality care for all beneficiaries. Despite the uncertanties, the picture is far more positive than last year - with the Affordable Care Act, we can make the future of Medicare secure.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What is the Donut Hole?</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2010/08/09/what-is-the-donut%c2%a0hole/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center of Medicare at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service</em>s</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A number of visitors to <a href="http://www.HealthCare.gov">www.HealthCare.gov</a> have told us they’d like to know more about the Medicare “donut hole” in the Part D program.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with <a href="http://www. Medicare.gov">Medicare</a>, it is a health insurance program for people 65 or older, people under 65 with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure). People with Medicare have the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. This prescription drug coverage is called Medicare Part D.</p>
<p>In 2010, basic Medicare Part D coverage works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay out-of-pocket for monthly Part D premiums all year.</li>
<li>You pay 100% of your drug costs until you reach the $310 deductible amount.</li>
<li>After reaching the deductible, you pay 25% of the cost of your drugs, while the Part D plan pays the rest, until the total you and your plan spend on your drugs reaches $2,800.</li>
<li>Once you reach this limit, you have hit the coverage gap referred to as the “donut hole,” and you are now responsible for the full cost of your drugs until the total you have spent for your drugs reaches the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit of $4,550.</li>
<li>After this yearly spending limit, you are only responsible for a small amount of the cost, usually 5% of the cost of your drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have read in the 2<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10050.pdf">010 Medicare &amp; You Handbook</a> that there are some Medicare Part D plans that offer coverage in the donut hole---but these plans may charge a higher monthly premium. (There are also some Part D plans that are “enhanced” and offer fixed co-pays (for example $5, $10, and $20) for prescription drugs instead of the deductible and 25% cost-sharing that was described above. These plans also may charge a higher monthly premium.)</p>
<p>For those that qualify, there is also a program called Medicare Extra Help that helps you pay your premiums and have reduced or no out-of-pocket costs for your drugs.</p>
<p>Needless to say, for most people with Medicare Part D, the donut hole presents serious financial challenges. Some people have had to choose between their rent or groceries and their prescription drugs.</p>
<p>But, the recent health reform law - the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11464.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> - has some important changes that will help to relieve this burden for the people with Medicare that hit the donut hole each year (and are not already on a program called Medicare Extra Help,):</p>
<ul>
<li>This year, if you enter the Part D donut hole, you will receive a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/moredonutchecks.html">one-time, $250 rebate check</a>. The mailing of these checks <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/moredonutchecks.html">began in June</a>. If you are eligible and do not receive your check, call your Part D plan first and then 1-800-Medicare.</li>
<li>Starting in 2011, you will receive a 50% discount on brand-name drugs in the donut hole, and you will start to pay less and less for your generic Part D drugs in the donut hole.</li>
<li>Starting in 2013, you will pay less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the donut hole.</li>
<li>By 2020, the coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and you will only pay 25% of the costs of your drugs until you reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this time, you will get continuous Medicare Part D coverage for your prescription drugs as long as you are on a prescription drug plan.</p>
<p>If you would like more information on the one-time rebate check, feel free to check out <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11464.pdf">this brochure</a> or call 1-800-MEDICARE. (Please note that you do not need to do anything to receive this rebate check and should not provide any personal information such as Medicare, Social Security or bank account numbers to anyone calling about the rebate.)</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services            
</em>
By now, everyone knows that smoking and tobacco use just aren’t good for you.  But that knowledge can be very abstract.  If it isn’t apparent that tobacco use is hurting you now, why quit?

Well, anyone who has ever battled lung cancer or lived with emphysema – or watched a loved one experience those conditions – knows that the consequences of smoking and tobacco aren’t abstract at all. And some people don't know that tobacco is a major risk factor for heart disease, just as it is for cancer.

So, when I tell you that almost half a million people have died from tobacco use in the past year, that probably seems abstract too.  (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/" title="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/"><span title="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/">estimates that cigarette smoking alone is responsible for 443,000 deaths per year</span></a>.)

Think of it this way: that is six times as many people as attended the Super Bowl last year. 

While it isn’t a new thing to say that tobacco is bad for your health, it is new for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" title="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><span title="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Medicare</span></a> to <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date" title="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date"><span title="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date">pay for a smoker or tobacco user to get cessation counseling</span></a> <i>before</i> they have symptoms of resulting disease.

Today, under a <a href="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp" title="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp"><span title="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp">new coverage decision</span></a>, anyone who smokes or uses tobacco and is covered by Medicare will be able to receive tobacco cessation counseling from a qualified physician or other Medicare-recognized practitioner who can work with them to help them quit.  (All people with Medicare will continue to have access to tobacco cessation prescription medication through the Medicare Prescription Drug Program.)

For the estimated 5.5 million people with Medicare who are smokers and may be looking to quit, the new benefit lowers a potential barrier to treatment. <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov/" title="http://www.smokefree.gov/"><span title="http://www.smokefree.gov/">Quitting</span></a> reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, or lung or other cancers.

  <title>Strengthening Medicare: Halting Cuts to Medicare Payments</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services
</em>

It’s important to protect the high-quality health care currently available to people with Medicare.  Unfortunately, the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that is scheduled to go into effect at the end of November has the potential to disrupt the health care that millions of Medicare beneficiaries rely on.

Today, in a speech to the Association of American Medical Colleges, I spoke about why this Administration has made it a priority to ensure this extreme cut in payments to doctors is addressed during the upcoming Congressional session. Here’s an excerpt from my speech:
<blockquote>“…[We] know that health care providers also face significant barriers as you strive to deliver the best care possible.  And we’re committed to working with you to reduce them.

That starts with preventing the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that’s scheduled to take effect at the end of the month. These drastic cuts could force doctors out of the Medicare program and jeopardize the care of our seniors.

On Thursday, I attended a Cabinet meeting where the President stressed that preventing these potentially disastrous cuts must be one of our top priorities. The American Medical Association has proposed a 13 month extension.  And I hope that Congress will act quickly to pass it, so that our doctors and seniors can have some peace of mind while we work on a long-term fix.

There’s been a lot of talk in the last few months about Medicare and its future. The single biggest step we can take to strengthen Medicare for seniors and disabled Americans is to make sure these disruptive cuts don’t take effect.

As the President has said many times, we will ultimately need a permanent fix, so that the livelihoods of the hard-working doctors who care for seniors and people with disabilities are no longer subject to politics. But in the meantime, we don’t want any doctor to be stuck in a limbo where they don’t know week to week how much they’ll be paid for the services they deliver.

That’s why we’re urging Congress to act now to make sure that you can continue to provide the high quality care our seniors depend on every day.”</blockquote>
Strengthening Medicare is a core value for this Administration. We will continue to act to ensure that the program and the people who receive care and provide care have the resources they need.

  <title>Your Start to a Healthy Future Begins with a Physical Exam</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Donald Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em>

If you’re new to Medicare, take charge of your health and wellness with a thorough physical exam.

Getting an in-depth physical exam is a smart and easy way for you and your doctor to set a starting point for your personalized health care. It’s your roadmap for effective, efficient and timely health care, and it will help lower our healthcare system’s per-person costs.

Medicare covers two types of physical exams—one when you’re new to Medicare and one each year after that.

<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html"><strong>"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</strong></a><strong></strong>

Medicare covers a one-time <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html">"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</a> if  you get it within the first 12 months you have Part B.  Beginning in 2011, you can get this exam for free if your doctor accepts assignment.

Your comprehensive “Welcome to Medicare” physical exam includes:
<ul>
	<li>A      review of your medical and social history including risk factors you can      change</li>
	<li>A      physical exam that includes measuring your height, weight, blood pressure,      visual acuity screen, and body mass index</li>
	<li>Education,      counseling, and referrals based on the results of your physical exam</li>
	<li>A      brief written plan, such as a checklist, for getting appropriate screening      and/or other Medicare Part B preventive services</li>
	<li>A      review of your potential risk factors for depression</li>
</ul>
<a title="links to the medicare physical exam page at medicare.gov" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx"><strong>Yearly “wellness” exam</strong></a>

Thanks to the new healthcare law, Medicare also covers a  yearly “wellness” exam (once you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months and if it has been at least 12 months from your “Welcome to Medicare” physical examination) which will help you develop or update a prevention plan, based on your current health and risk factors. You’ll pay nothing for the exam as long as your doctor accepts assignment (agrees to be paid directly by Medicare and accepts the amount Medicare approves for the service).

So get the most from your new Medicare benefits and stay in control of your health: Don’t delay.  Schedule your physical exam today!

  <title>Improving Care for People with Medicare</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>﻿﻿﻿By Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Crossposted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">﻿HealthCare.gov</a></em>

If you or a loved one has ever had the unfortunate experience of having a chronic or serious illness, you’ve experienced the frustration of our fragmented health care system. Just when you are feeling your worst, there you are in the doctor’s office or hospital room, repeating the same information time and time again, sitting through the same medical test more than once, and trying to track down lost or unavailable medical charts. These are all aspects of our current health care system we could each do without.

This can be a particular problem for the more than half of Medicare beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and kidney disease. These patients often receive care from multiple physicians and in multiple sites. A failure to coordinate care can lead to patients not getting the care they need or receiving duplicative care. This lack of coordination also increases their risk of suffering medical errors, such as receiving prescriptions for medications that ought not to be taken together. It can also cause complications that lead to needless hospital stays. Nearly one in five Medicare patients discharged from the hospital is readmitted within 30 days – a readmission many patients could have avoided if their care outside of the hospital had been better coordinated.

Improving coordination and communication among physicians and other providers and suppliers will help improve the care Medicare beneficiaries receive, while also helping lower costs. Numerous studies have shown that better care often costs less, because coordinated care helps to ensure that the patient receives the right care at the right time.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today released proposed new rules to help doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers better coordinate care for Medicare patients through Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are designed to create and support a team of health care providers who treat individual patients by working together across care settings.

Over the last months, CMS has conducted extensive outreach to patient advocates, doctors, nurses, hospitals, health plans, employers, and other interested stakeholders to hear their thinking about the best way to shape this effort. We will continue to seek feedback on the proposed rules released today so that the final rules reflect the broadest consensus on how to improve care for people with Medicare and to provide a model for private payers to draw upon. We look forward to working with patients and care providers to build the most patient friendly and cost-effective health care system achievable

Under the proposal, ACO teams of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers and suppliers working together would coordinate and improve care for patients with Original Medicare. ACOs would have to meet high quality standards in five key areas:

•Patient/Caregiver Experience of Care
•Care Coordination
•Patient Safety
•Preventive Health
•At Risk Population/Frail Elderly Health

An ACO will be rewarded for providing better care and investing in bettering the health and lives of patients. ACOs are not just a new way to pay for care. They are a new model for the organization and delivery of care. Accountable Care Organizations are designed to lift the burden of fragmented and disconnected care from patients, while improving the partnership among patients, doctors, hospitals and other providers of care in making health care decisions.

  <title>Applying New Protections to Your Health Plan </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>﻿By Karen Pollitz, Director for Consumer Support, Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/consumerprotections04062011.html">Healthcare.gov </a></em>

<em>HMO. PPO. COBRA. Participating Provider. Allowable charges. Claim Denied.</em> Sometimes it seems like health insurance is in a whole different language.

Knowing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/consumerprotections03312011.html">Affordable Care Act protections are in place </a>is one thing; but applying them to our own health plans or policies is another. Who doesn’t need help figuring out what it all means—starting with the terms of our coverage?

Today I’d like to tell you how you can put new protections and options to work for you.

Health insurance problems are difficult enough to sort through in the midst of our fast-paced lives, and they can be overwhelming when we’re facing illness or injury.

That’s why the Affordable Care Act included resources to strengthen existing or new Consumer Assistance Programs like the one that helped <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Consumerprotections03302011.html">the Schley family </a>maneuver the marketplace. If you need help with a health insurance problem or have a question about coverage or benefits, you can find out where to go in your state for help.

Our interactive Consumer Assistance Program Map , on HealthCare.gov will show you where you can find someone who “speaks insurance.” For consumers in states that didn’t apply for Consumer Assistance Program grants, the map offers links to a variety of public programs that may also be able to offer some assistance.

As you can see, there is a lot to celebrate in the first year. But, there is more to come down the road, and new rules will provide additional benefits to consumers. You will be hearing about new rules regarding more transparency in the marketplace so that consumers can be more informed about what services will be covered in plans.

And, starting in 2014, new state Health Insurance <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/index.html">Exchanges</a> will create more convenient and competitive marketplaces for individuals and small businesses. That same year, insurers will no longer be allowed to exclude anyone based on a pre-existing health conditions, which will offer more protection for consumers and increase access to care.

There is still plenty of work to do over the next few years. But first steps are important, and the consumer protections enacted through the Patient’s Bill of Rights this year have helped get us moving toward important changes for consumers. All Americans will benefit through the lower premiums, more efficient care, and other cost savings as the law unfolds over the next few years.

<em>Ed note: this is the third in a series of three blogs about consumer protections made available thanks to the Affordable Care Act.</em>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Consumerprotections03302011.html">I wrote about </a>the Schley family who experienced first-hand the new consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act. There are a number of provisions that will move us towards a fairer, more affordable health insurance system — including <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/billofright/patient_bill_of_rights.html">the Patient’s Bill of Rights</a>.

Because of health care reform, insurance companies:

•Can no longer deny coverage to children younger than 19 because of a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/ChildrensPCIP/childrenspcip.html">pre-existing condition </a>(Protection for adults will go into effect in 2014).
•Can’t take away your coverage based on an unintentional mistake you or your employer made on an application (also known as <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/Curbing%20Insurance%20Cancellations/cancellations.html">rescission of health coverage</a>.).
•Must allow most <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/youngadult/index.html">children up to age 26 </a>to stay on or be added to their parents’ family health plan.
•Must stop putting <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/limits/limits.html">lifetime dollar limits on coverage </a>(annual dollar limits are being phased out between now and 2014.)
•Must provide <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/choice_access/index.html">consumers their choice of any available primary care doctor </a>or pediatrician in a plan’s network.
•Must ensure access to out-of-network <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/choice_access/index.html">emergency care </a>without prior authorization or higher cost sharing that would otherwise be charged.
•Must meet certain basic standards when they review a consumer’s appeal of a denied claim. (The law also strengthens consumers’ rights to an independent “external” review when an insurer’s “internal review” upholds a claims denial.)
For most consumers, these protections kicked in sometime over the past few months at the start of a new plan or policy year. (Some plans in place when the Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 were “grandfathered” or exempt from some – but not all provisions. Always check with your plan or employer to find out if your plan is grandfathered.)

The consumer protections were designed to fix some of the most unfair practices of health insurers.

Congressional hearings in 2009, for example, shone a spot light on questionable rescissions in which insurance companies were cancelling coverage even when mistakes were unintentional or caused by other people. The primary care doctor provision was enacted because studies show that patients tend to experience better quality health care if they have long-term relationships with their health care provider. Other protections will improve the likelihood that children and young adults will get timely and appropriate health care services to be healthier, more productive adults down the road.

  <title>Consumer Protections: Celebrating First Steps Toward a New Insurance Marketplace </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Karen Pollitz, Director for Consumer Support, CCIIO. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Consumerprotections03302011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

During the past year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, some of us have personally experienced just how important the consumer protections—and other provisions-- are in addressing some of the most glaring problems in the insurance marketplace.

Among those celebrating the Affordable Care Act’s birthday is the Schley family of Circleville, New York. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, David and Patricia’s 23 year-old-daughter, who was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, was added to the family health insurance plan. But before their daughter could be added to the family health plan in January 2011, she needed coverage for the month before the dependent coverage provision became effective. Patricia and David read about the New York program for covering people with a pre-existing condition in the newspaper—a program that is now available in every state in the country as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Patricia next tapped into another resource that was available through the Affordable Care Act—the <a href="http://cciio.cms.gov/programs/consumer/index.html">Consumer Assistance Program (CAP)</a> in New York that provides case workers to help with insurance problems and questions. A caseworker in New York’s Consumer Assistance Program helped the family get the short-term coverage they needed in a timely manner. “Having a sick child, at any age, is stressful enough,” Patricia Schley said, but if your child in uninsured and the treatment for a condition like Crohn’s disease can cost up to $800 a month—having “to worry about how you’re going to pay for one bill after another only adds to the stress.”

For the Schley’s, the Affordable Care Act served up a “triple play” of protections, in the words of Elisabeth Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives with the Community Service Society, which runs the Consumer Assistance Program through 25 community-based organizations across New York. The triple play included: access to the new <a href="https://www.pcip.gov/">Pre-existing Condition Insurance Program (PCIP)</a>, coverage for adult children who are under 26, and the strengthening of Consumer Assistance Programs (CAP) through federal grants to a number of states and territories—including New York.

We may not all need a “triple play” to resolve a health insurance problem. But even a “single” play can resolve some problems that can be devastating. Just ask the 100 million Americans whose health insurance coverage imposed lifetime dollar limits before they were prohibited under the Affordable Care Act. Or the estimated 2 to 4 million individuals who faced high out-of-pocket spending when they used out-of-network emergency care providers before consumer protections were enacted.

Over the next couple of days, I’ll be writing in more detail about the new consumer protections and services, including the ones that helped the Schleys. Please check back to find out more about how these can help you and your family.

  <title>Paying Hospitals for Quality Care </title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/05/02/paying-hospitals-for-quality-care/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/hvbp.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

America has a skilled health care workforce and great hospitals. Every day, our health professionals are committed to improving care processes and systems for patients. Health care professionals have been encouraging Medicare to update payment procedures for a long time; validating the quality of care they provide to patients over the quantity. By improving transparency, we are envisioning a health system where all Americans get the best possible care. So how will your doctor, your hospital, and Medicare align to fight disease and provide you with the best possible care?

Today, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, created under the Affordable Care Act. This program provides hospitals with incentive payments based on their performance on a number of health care quality measures. These quality measures include:

•How quickly do heart attack patients receive potentially life-saving surgery?
•How often do patients with heart failure get the discharge instructions they need to help them care for themselves?
•How satisfied are patients with their experience of care at the hospital?

This is an important national initiative that will give hospitals greater financial incentives to continually improve how they deliver care. The better a hospital does on its quality measures, the greater the incentive payment it will receive from Medicare under the initiative. This will help improve the odds that every patient receives the best care, regardless of the location of treatment. It also encourages “patient-centered” care. The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program captures information about patient satisfaction with their care. It asks the important questions about how well hospital staff communicated with patients during and after a hospitalization and the overall cleanliness of the hospital environment.

As the largest payer for hospital services, Medicare is in a special position to reward hospitals for looking for ways to improve how a patient experiences an inpatient stay. The new program encourages hospitals to adopt practices that have been shown to be effective in improving patient outcomes. Equally important, it will be looking very carefully at whether the patient feels that he or she has been treated with respect and compassion, and has been given the opportunity to participate in decisions about treatment.

Are you wondering how your local hospital measures up?  Well, you can head to <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/compare/">www.HealthCare.gov/compare/</a> to find the Hospital Compare Care Quality tool to find out how hospitals across the country are doing on 44 different care quality measures. 

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program is just one part of a broad-ranging effort by the Obama Administration to improve the quality of health care for all Americans, using important new tools provided by the Affordable Care Act – including the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/center/programs/partnership/index.html">Partnership for Patients</a>.  

Through this program, Medicare is helping to improve patient safety and quality of care. The time has come for all of us to be on the same page and distinguish adequate care from excellent care. This payment plan places the patient at the center of care. Hospitals are now paid for how well they provide care, and more importantly, how well the patient does under their care. Together with our vigilant healthcare work force, hospitals will be able to continue to find ways to provide even more excellent care to every one of their patients.

  <title>Seniors in the Donut Hole Have Already Saved $166 Million on Prescription Drugs </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Crosspost from </em><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/seniors05242011.html"><em>Healthcare.gov</em></a>

The Affordable Care Act is cutting the cost of prescription drugs for millions of people with Medicare. Starting this year, people with Medicare receive a 50% percent discount on covered brand name drugs bought when they are in the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">donut hole</a>.

To receive the discount, no special action is required. Seniors simply purchase drugs at the pharmacy and receive the discount automatically.

So far, 271,000 people have used the discounts to save an average of $613 for a total of $166 million. These savings will continue to grow.  Most people who reach the donut hole do so later in the year, so we know more and more seniors will be helped as the year progresses.  But seniors with high costs are already receiving critical relief from prescription drug costs.

Most of these discounts are helping seniors with serious medical conditions – nearly 20% of the benefits provided to date – more than $32 million – are for cancer drugs and another nearly 10% – about $16 million – are for drugs provide to multiple sclerosis patients. 

Last year, Medicare provided immediate relief to seniors with high drug costs in the form of a one-time $250 rebate check for every person who fell into the donut hole.  Nearly 4 million seniors received checks to help defray the costs of prescription drugs.  This year that assistance has been expanded, and by the end of the decade - thanks to the health care law - the donut hole will be closed.

This is <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/2011medicarebenes.html">only part of</a> the help people with Medicare are getting this year.  Since January 1, people with Medicare may receive for an annual Wellness Visit with their doctor to make a plan to keep healthy  Also, all those with Medicare can receive recommended preventive care, including certain cancer screenings, for free.  All of these improvements to Medicare will help Americans with Medicare live longer, healthier lives.  That's the kind of good news we can all celebrate.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services

Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/prevention06062011a.html">HealthCare.gov</a>

There’s nothing more important than health. It’s what allows us to do our jobs, spend time with friends, and watch our children grow old. For America, the health of our citizens is the foundation of our prosperity. Healthy adults are more productive workers. Healthy children are better students. Healthy families can make longer-lasting contributions to their communities.
<div>

We know there’s more to good health than going to the hospital when you get sick. Good health starts with steps we can all take to avoid getting sick in the first place, from getting regular check-ups, vaccinations, and recommended screenings, to eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise.

In the past, our health care system functioned more like a sick care system. Even though seven of ten deaths in America and three quarters of our nation’s health expenditures are due to chronic diseases, we were investing only 4 cents of every health care dollar in prevention - the kind of care to keep people from getting diseases in the first place.

That is changing under the Obama Administration, and this June, we are marking our nation’s first-ever <em>Prevention and Wellness Month</em>. Over the next month, you can look forward to announcements, activities, and tips that will help you and your family get healthy and stay healthy.

For example, Americans now have new health benefits thanks to the health care law President Obama signed last year. Millions of people can now get cancer screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies, as well as vaccinations and counseling for chronic conditions like obesity, smoking, and depression, at no additional cost. And Medicare beneficiaries can now have a yearly health checkup with their doctor to develop and update a personalized wellness plan without having to pay anything out of pocket.

People want to make healthy eating choices for themselves and their families, so we’re putting more information in their hands. For example, we’re working with the food industry so that restaurants make their menu items easier to understand for health-conscious diners, and we’re working with food producers to improve and standardize nutrition labeling on the front and back of the package.

Everyone has a role to play in shaping America’s health. The good news is that communities across America have already been leading the way. Neighbors are planting community gardens, parents are organizing after-school programs, and local advocates are building new park trails. A big part of our health strategy is simply supporting these communities and sharing their ideas, so that they can become role models for the rest of the country.

And we know there are more good ideas out there, which is why we’ll also be asking you to share your own health and wellness tips this month. Tell us how you are contributing to a healthier future by leaving a comment on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/healthcaregov"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a> or by sending a tweet to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov"><strong>@HealthCareGov</strong></a> with the hashtag #prevention. We’ll feature some of your ideas on our blog and social media websites to help inspire others.

In the end, we’re all responsible for our own health. But we know that when we work together to make healthy choices easier and more affordable, everyone benefits. So during <em>Prevention and Wellness Month</em>, you’ll also learn about business initiatives that help make the workplace a healthier environment. And you’ll hear about how we’re working across government to make health a priority in everything from transportation to housing policy.

Across the country, Americans are taking on today’s health challenges in exciting, innovative ways that recognize the value of preventing health problems before they occur. If we can build on and expand these prevention and wellness efforts, the payoff won’t just fewer health problems. It will be longer, richer lives to share with your friends and family, and a stronger, more prosperous, and a more competitive nation for all of us.

<p>You take your car in for a yearly smog check, change the battery in your kitchen’s smoke detector, and file your taxes. These are all things that keep your life running smoothly and help prevent problems before they start.</p>
<p>But what about you? Do you use health services to help prevent illness? Unfortunately Americans use preventive health services at about half the recommended rate, often because of cost concerns. This is dangerous to our health because chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are responsible for 7 of 10 deaths among Americans each year and are often preventable.</p>
<p>Now, under the Affordable Care Act, you and your family may be eligible for important preventive services  –  for free. If you or your family enrolled in a new health plan on or after September 23, 2010, then your plan is required to cover certain recommended preventive services without charging you a copay, co-insurance or deductible. This means wellness and prevention services are now free and more accessible for you and your family.</p>
<p>For example, you may now have access to free preventive services such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood pressure readings, cholesterol tests, and nutrition counseling</li>
<li>Many cancer screenings, including mammograms and colonoscopies</li>
<li>Flu and pneumonia shots</li>
<li>Routine vaccinations against diseases such as measles, hepatitis, and meningitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For people <a href="http://themedicareblog.wordpress.com/law/provisions/medicare/preventiveservices.html">enrolled in Medicare</a>, you may now qualify for a yearly wellness exam and many preventive services for free.   More than 150,000 seniors and others with Medicare have received an annual wellness visit. The health care law is bringing new preventive benefits while helping to cut costs for seniors and keep them healthy.</p>
<p>Please visit this <a href="http://themedicareblog.wordpress.com/law/about/provisions/services/lists.html">page</a> for a complete list of covered preventive services.  To learn more about what preventive services are recommended for you, please visit <a href="http://finder.healthcare.gov/">http://finder.healthcare.gov/</a>. </p>

<div>

Today, we posted a new <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/disparities06092011a.html">factsheet</a> outlining the many ways in which the Affordable Care Act will reduce health disparities across the U.S. All across the country, low-income Americans, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT, and other underserved populations have not had adequate access to health care.

This means, these underserved populations are not able to take advantage of preventive services available to help them stay healthy and fight chronic disease. Now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Healthy choices will be made easy and affordable.</strong> All insurance plans will provide more Americans access to preventive services. Medicare and some private insurance plans will now cover recommended preventive services and states will be encouraged to do the same in Medicaid.</li>
	<li><strong>Access to quality health care in underserved communities will be improved.</strong> Over the next 5 years, the law provides $1 billion in funding for the operation, expansion and construction of community health centers across the country and invests in healthcare workforce programs.</li>
	<li><strong>Programs will be better targeted through advance scientific knowledge and innovation.</strong> The law invests in implementation of a new health data collection to identify and reduce disparities.</li>
	<li><strong>Create a fairer and easier way to understand the health care system.</strong> In 2014 insurance discrimination will be banned. A new, competitive health insurance marketplace will be created in 2014 to enable people to “one-stop-shop” and choose quality, affordable health insurance.</li>
</ul>
For more information on HHS’ commitment to reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities, check out the <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf">HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities</a>, which was announced this past April. Built on the strong foundation of the Affordable Care Act, the HHS Action plan is aligned with programs such as Healthy People 2020, the First Lady’s <em>Let’s Move</em> initiative, and the President’s National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This Action Plan outlines the goals and actions HHS will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities by promoting integrated approaches and best practices to reduce these striking disparities.

  <title>Prevention Just Makes Sense</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/06/20/prevention-just-makes-sense/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em>

“Prevention” is a word we use a lot in health care – June is “National Prevention and Wellness Month” – but I want to take a minute to think about what it really means.

Intuitively, prevention makes sense: as the saying goes, you can either pay now or you can pay later. But oddly enough, our health care system often doesn’t reflect this fundamental mindset. Most health care focuses on treating disease. Prevention, on the other hand, focuses on health.

Preventive care is also patient-centered care, as people become active participants in maintaining their health and get services customized for their individual needs and preferences.

We know that prevention works. The Affordable Care Act provides new ways to help patients stay healthy and makes <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/medicare/preventiveservices.html">access to preventive services easier</a>.

Today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="http://downloads.cms.gov/files/preventionreport.pdf">released a new report</a> showing that more than 5 million Americans with traditional Medicare, or nearly one in six people with Medicare, took advantage of one or more of the recommended preventive benefits now available for free thanks to the Affordable Care Act – most prominently, mammograms, bone density screenings, and screenings for prostate cancer.

These are just a few of the preventive services available to people on Medicare. Earlier this year, Medicare eliminated the Part B deductible and copayments for a host of preventive services, including bone mass measurement, some cancer screenings, diabetes and cholesterol tests, and flu, pneumonia, and hepatitis B shots.

We’ve also eliminated out-of-pocket costs for the “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit and, for the first time since the Medicare program was created in 1965, Medicare now covers an annual wellness visit with a participating doctor, also at no cost.

We’ve added expanded prescription drug benefits to the preventive arsenal as well. This year, people with Medicare started to benefit from a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">50% percent discount on covered brand name drugs</a> bought when they’re in the donut hole, and we’ll continue to chip away at the donut hole until it’s closed in 2020. Making prescription drugs more affordable increases the chance they’ll be taken as needed. Again – prevention just makes sense.

Find out which preventive services are right for you by taking <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-checklist.aspx">this checklist</a> to your doctor or other health care provider.

Our job now is to ensure that everyone eligible for Medicare uses these benefits. We need to encourage every person with Medicare, every caregiver, every physician to join our nationwide campaign for prevention. We are calling our campaign, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html"><strong><em>Share the News, Share the Health</em></strong></a>, which will run throughout the summer, with online ads and community events all over the country starting in July.

Focusing on prevention doesn’t just improve care – it’s also an important step in reducing the cost of health care. The financial costs of treating chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes are enormous. Add in the intangible costs of pain and suffering, and the very real economic costs of lost productivity, and the opportunity costs of chronic illness are simply unacceptable.

This is why we’re also working closely to incorporate best practices from the Centers for Disease Control, particularly around ways to reduce cardiovascular mortality. This type of collaboration is critical to moving us towards a prevention-based model of care.

Focusing on prevention also makes sense when we value treating the whole patient – not just a condition or disease. When we help people take better care of their health, everyone in the community benefits. If we wait to pay for care as illness progresses, the price of health care for the country will continue to rise.

Prevention just makes sense.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Keeping The System Clean: Fighting Medicare Fraud </title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/06/20/keeping-the-system-clean-fighting-medicare-fraud/</link>

<em>By Richard Sorian, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/stopmedicarefraud06172011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

</div>
<div>

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) teamed up with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the sixth Health Care Fraud Prevention Summit in Philadelphia. This historic moment in Medicare’s fight against fraud illustrates yet another way the health care law, the Affordable Care Act, is making America stronger, safer, and healthier.  In fact this law is one of the toughest anti-fraud laws in American history. Since of the launch of <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/heattaskforce/index.html">the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) task force</a> in 2009, over 670 defendants have been charged for attempting to defraud Medicare of more than $1.3 billion taxpayer dollars.

And we are continuing to use our resources to stop each instance of health care fraud before payments are sent out the door. We have to stay ahead of the criminals and identify their patterns of behavior. Luckily, we are beginning to utilize state-of-the-art analytic technology to predict and identify fraudulent claims in their early stages.

This technology is the same system your bank uses to protect you from potential credit card fraud. From now on, fraudulent Medicare claims will be identified and flagged the same way your card is when the bank sees two exorbitant charges within minutes of each other, 3,000 miles apart. Going forward, a contract between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Northrop Grumman in partnership with National Government Services and Verizon’s Federal Network Systems officially applies this industry-leading technology to our health care fraud prevention efforts.

So today, we are able to continue to build partnerships between public and private stakeholders, each committed to fight health care fraud. We must all invest in protecting the future of our health care system. The harder we work today, the stronger our system will be for years to come.

As we strive to stop Medicare fraud in its tracks, here are some useful tips for you to <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">stop Medicare fraud</a> in your own home:
<ul>
	<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. Treat them like you would treat your credit cards.</li>
	<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. If it’s free, they don’t need your number!</li>
	<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay to use your Medicare ID card or your identity. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</li>
</ul>

You have your grocery list. You have your “to-do” list. You even have a post-it note stuck to your steering wheel in your car reminding you to get your oil changed. We write things down to help us remember when life gets busy.  And when it comes to your health, there seem to be about a million things to remember. So why don’t you have a checklist dedicated to the care and keeping of you?

Take this <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-checklist.aspx">checklist</a> to your doctor or other health care provider to find out what preventive services are right for you. This comprehensive check-list spells out the Medicare covered preventive services and allows you to keep track of when you received a particular test, screening, or service, as well as when you are due for your next one. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, these preventive services ranging from mammograms and flu shots to a yearly “wellness” visit, are offered free of charge to patients covered by Medicare.

 <a href="http://themedicareblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/062211blog-checklist.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-188" title="062211blog-checklist" src="http://themedicareblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/062211blog-checklist.gif" alt="" width="417" height="215" /></a>

Be sure to visit <a href="https://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to continue tracking your preventive services. You can get a two-year calendar of the Medicare-covered tests and screenings you’re eligible for. You can even print a personalized report to take with you to your next doctor’s appointment.

To help spread the word about Medicare’s preventive benefits, we just launched the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">Share the News, Share the Health</a> campaign.  Help us spread the word by telling your friends and family with Medicare about the difference these preventive benefits can make.

So don’t forget to pick up your milk and bread at the grocery store, and build time in to your busy schedule to get your oil changed. But also make sure you have your preventive services checklist updated and ready for your next doctor’s appointment. That way, you will know the right questions to ask your doctor to guarantee you are receiving the preventive services you need.

  <title>Affordable Care Act Saves $260 Million This Year </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

<em>By Donald M. Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Cross posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Seniors06282011a.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

<div>

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, almost half a million individuals enrolled in Medicare’s prescription drug benefit have received a 50 percent discount on their out-of-pocket costs in the first five months of 2011.

Because of Medicare improvements in the Affordable Care Act, beneficiaries now automatically receive a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs in the Part D coverage gap, or <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">“donut hole,”</a> and have saved more than $260 million so far this year.

In May alone, we have seen a 76 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries receiving this discount (478,272 individuals through the end of May <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/seniors05242011.html">compared to</a> 270,900 through the end of April). In addition, the total savings these beneficiaries received grew over 56 percent in one month, for a total average savings of $545 per beneficiary (<a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/donuthole06282011a.html">for state-by-state figures, please click here</a>).

Most of these discounts are helping Americans with serious medical conditions – nearly 14 percent of the benefits provided to date – more than $36 million – are for cancer drugs, more than 8 percent or $21 million for drugs to help control high blood pressure and cholesterol, and another more than 7 percent – about $20 million – are for drugs provides to diabetic patients.

As more and more beneficiaries hit the donut hole through the rest of this year, the numbers will continue to climb. All of these beneficiaries will see savings on their drug costs that were not available in previous years.

And cheaper prescriptions are just one of the many ways the Affordable Care Act is improving Medicare for seniors. Thanks to the new law, many preventive care screenings are available free of charge. As of June 10, we found that about 5.5 million people with Medicare have accessed one or more preventive measures and last week, we launched a new awareness effort– <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/prevention06202011a.html"><em>Share the News, Share the Health</em></a> – to highlight Medicare’s preventive benefits and encourage Medicare beneficiaries taking advantage of these potentially lifesaving services.

More information on the free preventive services that are available to people on Medicare can be found on the “Manage Your Health” tab at <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.Medicare.gov</a>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:Calibri;">When I’m getting ready to buy a new product, I will look for the clerk at the store and ask all kinds of questions.  However, when I see the doctor, I find that I don’t ask questions because I’m not sure what to ask, or I’m too embarrassed to ask. Let’s face it, many in our Hispanic community prefer to ask a coworker, friend or even a family member about health concerns or treatment advice rather than going to the doctor. </span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">Well, now there’s a  </span><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Spanish Web site</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that can help us ask the right questions and can improve communication with our doctors. </span><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Conozca las preguntas</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> (Know the questions. Questions, answers and health tips for the Hispanic community) offers tips and sample questions to help you prepare for your medical appointments. You can even get biweekly tips on how to talk to your doctor. There’s also a </span><a href="http://4in.fo/Y9SAwg"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Web site</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> available for smart phones.</span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">If you ask questions and talk openly with your doctor, you can improve not only your health, but also your quality of care.  </span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Freeing Doctors to Focus on Patients, Not Paperwork </title>

<em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/simplification06302011.html" target="_blank">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

</div>
<!-- end postinfo -->
<div>

Did you know your doctor has to spend 12 cents of every dollar she makes to hire staff just to fill out insurance forms and other paperwork?  Wouldn’t you rather she spend that time with you?

Today, the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/06/20110630a.html">Department of Health and Human Services issued rules</a> to simplify the mounds of paperwork that doctors, nurses, and other caregivers have to complete in order to get paid for treating you. We estimate that these changes will save our health care system $12 billion over the next 10 years.  More important, it will free caregivers to spend more time with you. We estimate these changes will give doctors back four hours a week and another five hours to their staff.

This common-sense streamlining means fewer phone calls between physicians and health plans, lower postage and paperwork cots, and fewer denied claims.  All in all, this means physicians can cut through the red tape and spend more time and money administering quality care to their patients.

Under these rules, called for by the Affordable Care Act, doctors and other health care professionals will be able to use a simple, streamlined form to ask your insurance company if you are eligible for benefits.  And a second form will be used for doctors’ offices to check to the status of insurance claims they have filed. And insurers have agreed to accept these forms rather than use multiple systems.

This is only the beginning of our efforts to cut out waste and inefficiency in our health care system and free dedicated doctors, nurses, and caregivers to focus their time and efforts on keeping patients healthy, treating illness, and restoring health.  Stay tuned.

Do you have Medicare? Have questions about what the Affordable Care Act does for you?

Here are the five things people with Medicare should know about the law:

<strong>1. <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">It makes prescription drugs more affordable.</a></strong>

If you enter the coverage gap known as the “donut hole,” you will receive a 50% discount when buying Part D-covered brand-name prescription drugs. This discount will be automatically applied at the counter of your pharmacy; you don’t have to do anything to get it. And over the next ten years, you will get additional savings until the coverage gap is completely closed in 2020.

<strong>2</strong>. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-overview.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><strong>It gives you preventive care services for free.</strong></a>

If you have Medicare, you can get free preventive screenings and services like colorectal cancer screening and mammograms. You can also get a free yearly wellness visit to develop and update your personal prevention plan based on current health needs. Again, these services are free: no co-pays or cost-sharing for you.

<strong>3. <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/center/programs/partnership/">It provides incentives for your doctors to work together for you.</a></strong>

The law makes it easier for your doctors to work together by offering them support and resources for patient-centered care.  If you’re hospitalized, the new law also helps you return home successfully—and avoid going back—by helping to coordinate your care and connecting you to services and support in your community.

<strong>4. It strengthens Medicare Advantage.</strong>

If you have Medicare Advantage, you will be protected from large increases to your premiums or decreases in your benefits.  Medicare reviews changes to your plan before they happen to stop the ones that are unreasonable. Beginning in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans will have even more reason to improve the quality of care you receive.  Plans that have a rating of three stars or more on the quality rating system will receive a bonus, part of the national effort to improve quality.

<strong>5. It helps ensure your access to care.</strong>

You can still choose your doctor. The law increases the number of primary care doctors, nurses, and physician assistants to provide better access to care through expanded training opportunities, student loan forgiveness, and bonus payments. Support for community health centers will increase, allowing them to serve some 20 million new patients.

<ul>
	<li><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx"><strong>Flu Shots</strong></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter. <strong></strong></li>

Getting your shots has never been easier. As we approach the fall season, you will see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. As long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot, you pay nothing.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Better Health and Lower Costs for Medicare Beneficiaries </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

<em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/medicare08042011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

</div>
<div>

It’s been a big summer for the millions of Americans who are benefitting from improved Medicare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The benefits are clear: More people are getting preventive services to keep them healthy and people with high prescription drug costs are seeing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">donut hole coverage gap</a> starting to close – lowering the cost of drugs so that people don’t have to worry about being able to afford the care they need. Take a look at the past few months:
<ul>
	<li><strong>June:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Through the end of June, 899,000 Americans with Medicare have benefited from the discount on brand name drugs in the Medicare Part D "donut hole" coverage gap -- an increase of over 420,000 individuals in the month of June alone.</li>
	<li>These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of $461 million, including $200 million in June alone!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>July:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Through the end of July, 17.3 million people with traditional Medicare, or 51.5 percent, have received one of more free preventive services. </li>
	<li>During the same time period, over 1 million Americans with traditional Medicare have taken advantage of Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit, up from 780,000 in mid-June;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
To learn more about these new benefits, check out the Medicare campaign, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/"><em>“Share the News, Share the Health”</em></a>, to learn about the importance of prevention for people with Medicare.

But the good news doesn’t stop here. Over the coming years, provisions of the Affordable Care Act will help close the donut hole coverage gap completely. Here is a sense of what Medicare beneficiaries can look forward to:
<ul>
	<li><strong>2013:</strong> You will pay less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the donut hole.</li>
	<li><strong>2020:</strong> The coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and you will only pay 25% of the costs of your drugs until you reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
The chart below shows Medicare prescription drug savings over time:
<div align="center">
<table summary="Medicare prescription drug savings over time" width="60%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

This all amounts to even more examples of how the Affordable Care Act is providing better health care for people covered by Medicare and making a difference in the lives of millions of Americans.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The health care providers and facilities you choose can affect your health – finding the right expertise and specialists may speed your recovery and improve how well your treatment works. We’ve just updated <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> and the <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> with more information to help you compare health care facilities. And our new <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/qualitycarefinder">Quality Care Finder</a> is updated regularly to provide you with an easy way to search for health care professionals, services, and facilities.

Use these resources to make informed decisions about which facilities you choose:<strong></strong>

<strong>Nursing Homes</strong>
Medicare’s <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> now has information about:

-          Nursing home health inspections and what happens after a facility is inspected

-          Complaints filed about a nursing home in the last 3 years

-          Incidents that a nursing home self-reported in the last 3 years

-          Enforcements, which are monetary penalties and denials of payments, that a nursing home received in the last 3 years

This information, along with the existing measures including quality of care and staffing, can help you compare the care you’ll get at different nursing homes and the specialties they offer. You can now read complaints filed at each nursing home, and find out how they affected residents’ care. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursing/checklist.pdf">Nursing Home Checklist</a> to track information about different nursing homes you visit.

<strong>VA Hospitals</strong>
The <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> helps Veterans compare the quality of care at VA hospitals based on:

-          Reducing preventable surgical complications (part of the Surgical Care Improvement Project) including:
<ul>
	<li>Infections</li>
	<li>Blood clots</li>
	<li>Heart (cardiac) problems</li>
	<li>Breathing (respiratory) problems</li>
</ul>
-          Measures about death (mortality) rates, readmissions to the hospital, and best treatments for these medical conditions:
<ul>
	<li>Congestive Heart Failure</li>
	<li>Heart Attack</li>
	<li>Pneumonia</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Do you know about the “Beneficio Adicional” or “Extra Help” program? My mother always told me if you wanted to know anything, you went to “la plaza del pueblo” (town square).  You went to socialize with neighbors, exchange important news, pass “chisme” (gossip) and take part in the community. The plaza was all about conversation and learning from one another what’s really happening in the world. We may have left the plaza behind, but the tradition of sharing information is as vital as ever. Blogs, IM, chat and social media are now our plaza. So here is some important information you might want to pass on. </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for Medicare’s “Extra Help” program, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and co-payments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them. </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">It’s easy and free to apply for “Extra Help.”  </span></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Visit Social Security’s </span><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/beneficioadicional"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Web site</span></span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;"> (in Spanish or English) to apply online or for more information.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 to apply over the phone or request an application (TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778). </span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Apply at your local </span><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Social Security</span></a><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> office.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Save money, live well, and share the information, because this program is too important to keep to yourself.</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.

Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft. 

Here are some things you can do:

•	Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>. 

•	Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.

•	Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong> 

•	Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.

•	Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud.

•	Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud. TTY users should call
1-877-486-2048.

Medicare is cracking down on fraud, and so can you. 

•	<a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">Learn more </a>about spotting and reporting fraud, and get tips on protecting yourself from identity theft. 
•	Find out about <a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">Senior Medicare Patrol </a>activities in your area.

  <title>Put Insurance on Your Back-to-School Checklist</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Pencils, backpack, lunch box? All covered. How about health insurance?

If you’re one of the millions of hard-working families without health insurance, there’s great news: the <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</strong></a> covers more kids than ever. CHIP offers low-cost or free health insurance for babies, children, and teens, even if you’re working or you’ve been turned down by state programs before.

CHIP pays for doctor visits, prescriptions, and hospitalizations. Most states also cover dental care, eye care, and medical equipment. What you pay depends on your state and your income, but many services are free, and charges for others are small.

<strong>Protect Your Child’s Health &amp; Future</strong>

With coverage through CHIP, you can see a doctor when your child gets sick, without having to worry about how you’ll pay for it. Your kids can get the shots and well-child visits they need to attend school and play sports. 

The fact is, children with health insurance are more likely to be healthier and miss fewer school days. When they do get sick, you won't have to sit for hours in the emergency room for conditions that could be easily treated in your doctor's office. 

<strong>Applying for CHIP Is Easy &amp; Free</strong>

In most states, you can complete a short application through the mail or over the phone. Visit <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>insurekidsnow.gov</strong></a>, or make a free call to <strong>1-877-KIDS-NOW (1-877-543-7669).  </strong>

Many families think they make too much money to qualify, but you’d be surprised. If you’re a grandparent or legal guardian, many states also let you apply for the children in your care.]]></content:encoded>

Millions of Americans are enjoying improved Medicare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. More people are getting preventive services to keep them healthy, and people with high prescription drug costs are seeing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">coverage gap</a> “donut hole” starting to close. Here are the latest numbers from the past few months:
<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>July:</strong>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Through the end of July, 1.28 million Americans with Medicare have received discounts on brand name drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap — up from 899,000 through the end of June and 478,000 through the end of May.</li>
	<li>These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of$660 million, including $199 million in July alone!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
For state-by-state information on the number of people who are benefiting from this discount in 2011, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Plan-Payment/">visit this page</a>.
<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>August:</strong>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Through the end of August, over 18.9 million people with Original Medicare, or 55.6 percent, have received one or more free preventive services.</li>
	<li>During the same time period, over 1.2 million Americans with Original Medicare have taken advantage of Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit, up from 1.06 million in July.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
For state-by-state information on the numbers of people who are utilizing preventive services in 2011, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/NewMedia/02_preventive.asp">visit this page.</a>

Over the coming years, provisions of the Affordable Care Act will help close the coverage gap completely. Here is a sense of what people with Medicare can look forward to:
<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>2013:</strong> Paying less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the coverage gap.</li>
	<li><strong>2020:</strong> The coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and people with Medicare will pay only 25% of the costs of their drugs until they reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
The chart below shows what people with Medicare prescription coverage will pay over time:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Health care decisions can be tough – and they’re even harder when insurance forms, instructions and policy information aren’t written clearly.  At Medicare, it’s our job to make sure you can use our materials.

That’s why we’re committed to speaking and writing about the Medicare program in plain language. It’s another way we’re working to make health care information easier for you to use and understand.

The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h946enr.txt.pdf"><strong>Plain Writing Act of 2010</strong></a> means that plain language isn’t just good sense - now, it’s the law.  As a Federal agency, we’re required to make sure our letters, booklets, Web pages, and any other materials are clear, concise, and easy for you to act on.

We’re working hard to comply with the new law. We’re training our employees, reviewing our materials, and finding new, easier ways to communicate about our programs using the <a title="Link to Federal Plain Language Guidelines" href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/bigdoc/TOC.cfm"><strong>Federal Plain Language Guidelines</strong></a>.

But we need your help—how are we doing here at Medicare?

We’d like you to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx#survey"><strong>let us know</strong></a> if you have trouble understanding our documents or the pages on our Web site. We need to know, so we can make these things better.

Most of all, we want to give you the clear and accurate information you need to make good decisions for your family. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx#survey"><strong>Tell us how we’re doing.</strong></a>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Better Choices, Sooner</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/09/15/medicare-open-enrollment-better-choices-sooner/</link>

  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://blog.medicare.gov/?p=277</guid>
  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em>

Every year, people with Medicare get to explore new choices and pick the plans that work best for them. This year, this Open Enrollment period is starting early – on October 15 – and ending sooner – December 7.

As health plans start their marketing and advertising activities in just a few weeks, we want people to know that the Medicare program is strong and, in 2012, they have a broad array of choices. And, there are lots of new benefits thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

Every person with Medicare will have to choose a “Part D” plan to help them pay for prescription drugs. And people who have chosen to enroll in a “Part C” Medicare Advantage plan for their basic health care services have the option of staying in that plan, choosing a different plan, or going back to the Original Medicare program. These are important choices that should be made with care.

The good news is we have strengthened consumer protections and improved plan choices. We’re making it simpler for people to choose a new health or drug plan by reducing the number of duplicate plans. We’ve also worked with plans to reduce cost sharing on important benefits like inpatient hospitalization and mental health services.

And, thanks to our enhanced bargaining power we can report that average premiums for a Part D plan will be the same in 2012 as in 2011. The average premium for Part C plans is going down by 4 percent. That’s great news for people on Medicare who have a fixed income.

As with last year, people with Medicare will continue to have a variety of Medicare Advantage plan choices. Consumers in every part of the country will have a wide variety of Part D plan choices in 2012, including many plans with zero deductibles and plans with some form of generic gap coverage.

People with Medicare are also enjoying important new benefits. Every person is entitled to an Annual Wellness Visit with their doctor so that they can discuss their health and their health care needs. Prevention services like mammograms and other cancer screenings are now available with no cost-sharing. And people who reach the donut hole in their drug costs will get a 50% discount on covered brand name drugs and a 14 percent discount on generics. That puts money back in your pockets.

More good news for consumers is the fact that we’ll be closely monitoring marketplace performance to protect people from misleading information or prohibited tactics by a small minority of unscrupulous plans. Medicare plans are on notice: we’ll move quickly to take action against plans found to be violating marketing rules.

In short, there’ll be a wide range of health and drug plan options available across the country, including Original Medicare. People can turn to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.medicare.gov</a>, call the 1-800-MEDICARE hotline, or consult with a local State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) for help. We want to make sure people can identify and enroll in the coverage option that suits their needs in 2012.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you ever just get home from your doctor’s appointment and remember something you wanted to ask or share with the doctor? 

Whether you’re at your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/visit.html">Welcome to Medicare Preventive Visit</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx">your Yearly Wellness Visit</a>, or seeing the doctor for a specific problem, you get better care by asking questions and giving your doctor complete information.

You’re busy, and so is your doctor. Taking time to prepare your questions before your visit will help you get the most out of your health care.  Try these 10 basic questions to get started:
<ol>
	<li>What is the test for?</li>
	<li>How many times have you done this procedure?</li>
	<li>When will I get the results?</li>
	<li>Why do I need this treatment?</li>
	<li>Are there any alternatives or other options?</li>
	<li>What are the possible complications?</li>
	<li>Which hospital is best for my needs?</li>
	<li>How do you spell the name of that drug?</li>
	<li>Are there any side effects?</li>
	<li>Will this medicine interact with medicines that I'm already taking?</li>
</ol>
For more information and to feel more satisfied about your health care, visit the <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/questions/tenquestions.htm">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Question Builder</a> and keep track of questions and answers. 

A simple question can help you feel better, help you take better care of yourself, and may save your life.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size:small;">Have you had your mammogram this year? Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it's the most treatable. </span><span style="font-size:small;">All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months - and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/breast-cancer-screening.aspx">Medicare covers it for free</a></span> if your doctor accepts assignment. </span>

<span style="font-size:small;">Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening.  Ask your family members and friends if they've had theirs - share the health. </span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Medicare Is Stronger Than Ever</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em>

With the start of this year’s Medicare Open Enrollment less than two weeks away, I can’t stress one point enough: Medicare is stronger than ever. Consumers have more and better Medicare options than ever before.

Seniors this year can expect more choices, more benefits, and lower overall costs. 

Because it’s a fact:  99% of you have at least one Medicare Advantage plan in your area. And everyone with Medicare can get a host of preventive tests and screenings —more than ever before — at absolutely no cost to you.  Medicare also continues to cover an Annual Wellness Visit – a great chance to talk with your doctor or other health provider about treating small problems and concerns before they become big ones.

Here’s the best part: even with these improved benefits, people won’t be feeling it in their pocketbooks.  Average premiums for Part D drug coverage are holding steady in 2012, and premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are actually <em>dropping</em> an average of 4%. And people who reach the Part D coverage gap will get a 50% discount on brand name drugs. 

This is all great news for the 47 million American seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare.

We know that more choices can make decisions challenging, but we’ve expanded the Medicare safety net to make sure folks can get the help they need to sift through their options.  You can even get an early start — we’ve already made sure the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is fully updated with all new 2012 cost and benefit information for health and drug plans.  If you’re the kind of person who likes to get online yourself and sort through the details, you can use this online tool right now.  Start by entering your drugs and checking on the doctors and pharmacies you want to use.  A few steps will get you to a personalized list of your plan choices and help you compare.   

If you’d rather get a personal hand walking through your choices, we’ve got help for you, too. You can call or visit one of the thousands of wonderful volunteers staffing the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs across the country. 

One more way we’re going to help – every week during Open Enrollment, we’re going to have some of our top health care experts adding tips and advice to this blog, to give you some important things to consider as you weigh your choices.  When Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7, we want every single American with Medicare to have health and drug coverage that meets their needs.   Are you ready?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: 4 Places to Look for Medicare Information</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Julie Green Bataille, Director of Communications </em>

Whether it’s apple picking or Sunday afternoon football, there’s a comfort in things that happen every fall. Shorter days and cooler nights also mark the start of Medicare Open Enrollment. Between now and December 7, you can expect to hear about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">choices, benefits, and lower overall costs</a> you have when it comes to Medicare - many of them thanks to the health care law.

Open Enrollment is your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you are happy sticking with the plan you have.  The health care law extended the Open Enrollment period and made it earlier – giving you more time to make choices and giving Medicare time to process everything so your coverage starts without a hitch on January 1<sup>st</sup>.This year, you can make any changes as early as October 15.<strong> </strong>

Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits.  Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Medicare Open Enrollment calendar</a> tells you what to look for this fall, especially in these 4 everyday places:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Your mailbox
</strong>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any extra help you may get paying for prescription drugs.Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">Medicare &amp; You</a> handbook.  Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. This year, it may be in your email inbox instead – if you decide to “go green” and asked to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Library/PDFNavigation/PDFInterim.asp?Language=English&amp;Type=Pub&amp;PubID=10050">get it electronically</a>. But whether it’s on your computer or on your bookshelf, now is the time to take it out and find out what’s new in Medicare.

You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from <strong>you</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>On your computer
</strong>Comparing your plan choices is important –and our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it as simple as possible. Soon, you’ll be able to watch a video about how the Plan Finder works. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review a the plan’s <a href="http://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">star ratings</a> to compare plans based on quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs.</li>
	<li><strong>In newspaper, newsletters, and magazines
</strong>Take a moment as you enjoy that morning coffee to read the Medicare information that’s out there.  You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it.</li>
	<li><strong>On television and radio
</strong>At the end of one of those shorter days, as you relax in front of the television, you may see some advertisements or programming about Medicare plans and your new choices.  You might also hear some advertisements on your way to or from work as you listen to the radio.Now is the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.</li>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Things to Think About When Comparing Plans</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator for Medicare</em>

Every day we are faced with choices.  We check the weather forecast to help us decide what to wear.  We might look over the supermarket sale ad to help us figure out what to have for dinner.  I’ll bet that sometime today, without even realizing it, you’re going to gather some information and use it to help you make a decision.  Some of those choices might be harder than others.

In my work with the Medicare program, I know that choices are a good thing.  But I’m also aware – because some of you have told me -- that sorting through your health and drug coverage choices during <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment</a> can be confusing — especially when many Medicare plans seem to offer similar benefits.

That’s why making Medicare easier to access has been one of our top priorities. The Affordable Care Act is helping us do this, in addition to delivering <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">better choices, more benefits, and lower overall costs</a> to the Medicare program.

We’ve been working to make Medicare less confusing by steadily phasing out duplicative plans, and shoring up our website, toll-free call center and community programs to make it easier for people to find Medicare coverage that works for them.

This year, when you sit down to review your Medicare health and drug plan choices, here are some things I hope you think about:

<strong>Are the services you need covered?</strong>

We know future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Maybe your family situation is different this year, or you have different health concerns. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year.

Remember that no matter what plan you pick, you’ll have access to a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/65-older/medicare-preventive-services/index.html">variety of preventive tests and screenings, at no cost to you</a>, thanks to the health care law.

<strong>Do you have any other coverage?</strong>

You may have other health insurance from a current or past job, or through a family member.  If you do, you’ll want to understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare. You may want to just keep what you have.

<strong>Costs</strong>

How much are your premiums and deductibles? How much do you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits? Is it important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year?  Just like with everything else, the lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you.

<strong>Doctor and hospital choice</strong>

We understand the relationships you have with your doctors and providers are important. Do your doctors accept your coverage? Do you have to choose your hospital from a network? Do you need to get referrals?  With Original Medicare, you can always go to any doctor or hospital that accepts new Medicare patients.

<strong>Drug coverage</strong>

Do you need to join a Medicare drug plan? Will you pay a penalty if you join a drug plan later? How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan? Even if you don’t take many drugs now, you might want the peace of mind of knowing you’re covered.

<strong>Quality of care</strong>

Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Look for plans with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.

<strong>Convenience</strong>

Your time is valuable, too. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use electronic health records or prescribe electronically? Remember that even if you are happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.

<strong>Travel plans</strong>

Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.

Only you know what’s most important to you and your family – that’s why we want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for you.  Look around for all the Medicare information out there [link to second blog in series]. And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need to walk through your options.  Now, what’s for dinner?]]></content:encoded>

Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/deliveryreform10202011.html">HealthCare.gov</a>.

Posted October 20, 2011

Your doctors try hard to give you the best care possible, but it can be a challenge to get all the information they need to protect your health.  For people with Medicare, this is particularly important because a significant number of people over age 65 and those with disabilities live with one or more chronic conditions. That is why I’m so pleased with the work we are doing with doctors and hospitals to find ways to improve care and reduce costs.

When doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers are able to work together they provide better, more coordinated health care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they can do that by becoming an Accountable Care Organization (ACO)<strong>.</strong>

By taking this step, providers will be able to communicate closely with each other about your health with the goal of delivering better and more coordinated care while meeting your needs and preferences. Doctors will be able to spend more time with patients. And specialists and primary care doctors will communicate more to ensure that you get the care you need.

Medicare will help doctors and hospitals that choose to participate ensure you are getting the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  And if that care coordination lowers costs, doctors and hospitals as well as Medicare can share in the savings – shifting payments toward value rather than volume of care.

Your Medicare benefits will stay the same. You can see still see any doctor or healthcare provider who accepts Medicare – even if your doctor chooses to participate in this program. Nobody – not your doctor, not anyone – can limit your choice on who you see.

If your provider decides to participate, you will be notified. For more information, talk to your doctor or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-8227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.

This is just one of many ways the Affordable Care Act is helping your doctors spend more time with you to help you to stay healthy and to get better.  Learn more <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/deliveryreform10172011.html">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>4 Ways to Protect Your Identity and Personal Information</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Peter Budetti, Deputy Administrator for Program Integrity</em>
<ol>
	<li>Guard your information.</li>
	<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
	<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
	<li>If you spot something, say something</li>
</ol>
These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard. 

During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/"><span style="color:#003399;">choices, benefits, and lower costs</span></a> you have when it comes to Medicare.

Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes. 

During Open Enrollment, you’ll find Medicare information all around you <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/"><span style="color:#003399;">– in the mail, on TV, in the paper, and on your computer</span></a>.  Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:    

<strong>1.    </strong><strong>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards. </strong>

You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans. 

It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <strong>never</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>never</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.  If a sales agent does call or visit you uninvited they are violating the Medicare marketing rules.

<strong>2.    Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</strong>

 Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!

<strong>3.    </strong><strong>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</strong>

If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <strong>don’t</strong> give them your Medicare number. 

<strong>4.   Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</strong> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).

Medicare is stronger than ever, and we need your help to keep it that way. The health care law is doing a lot to help us fight Medicare fraud and make America stronger, safer, and healthier. 

Want to help? You can get tips on protecting yourself from identity theft at <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/"><span style="color:#003399;">stopmedicarefraud.gov</span></a>. Learn more about spotting and reporting fraud, and learn about our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers who are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.

Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Keeping Medicare Affordable in 2012</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/27/keeping-medicare-affordable-in-2012/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/medicare10272011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

Across the country, people with Medicare are now considering their options for 2012. Medicare’s annual <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/openenrollment101111.html">Open Enrollment </a>period opened on October 15 and closes December 7. While that seven-week period is longer than usual, it also ends on an earlier date. So seniors and people with disabilities along with their families and caregivers are examining their options and making their choices now.

The good news is there are better choices available and we’re controlling the cost of coverage. Earlier this year, we announced that premiums for Part D prescription drug coverage will remain virtually unchanged and average Medicare Advantage plan premiums will actually go down by 4 percent. That’s the second consecutive year of falling premiums for the millions of people who choose Medicare Advantage.

Today, we have more good news. Medicare’s Part B monthly premium, which helps pay for physicians’ services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, and other items, is rising by only $3.50 despite earlier projections of a much bigger jump.

For the last two years, the Part B premium has been frozen for most people with Medicare because their Social Security benefits were not increasing. But this year, Social Security benefits are rising 3.6 percent to cover inflation – the same percent increase as Medicare’s premium. For example, the typical retired worker will see a $39 per month increase in their Social Security check. This more than offsets the modest $3.50 change in Medicare premiums which will be the same percent of Social Security checks in 2012 as they were in 2008. In addition, Medicare’s Part B deductible will actually fall by over $20, from $161 to $140.

At the same time, Medicare is providing new benefits thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The health reform law reduces prescription drug costs for people who hit the donut hole and makes preventive benefits like cancer screenings and cholesterol tests free for everyone with Medicare. Through September 2011, nearly 20.5 million people in traditional Medicare received a free preventive service. Through August of this year, nearly 1.8 million people who hit the donut hole received these discounts, saving almost $1 billion – coming to an average of $530 per beneficiary.

Put simply, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare is providing <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/07/medicare07282011.html">better benefits at lower costs</a>. Today’s announcement means seniors will have more money in their pocket. And seniors and people with disabilities are getting a Medicare program that’s stronger for today and tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Looking at Costs</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/01/medicare-open-enrollment-looking-at-costs/</link>
  <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 14:28:57 +0000</pubDate>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center of Medicare </em>

In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs.  Maybe we clip a few more coupons, eat out less, or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. 

Cost is a primary driver in any marketplace, and health care is no different. We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. Wouldn’t most of us like to get more and pay less for things that are important to us?

The good news is, the health care law has gone a long way toward <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">lowering overall costs</a> in the Medicare program.  But getting good value out of your health insurance still requires you to make smart choices.

There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage.  How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year?

Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan?  Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember that this year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">50% discount on covered brand-name drugs</a>.

Finding the right plan can save you hundreds — or even thousands — over the course of a year. In Florida, State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselors used the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to help one senior find a drug plan that covered all but one of her 17 medications, saving her $510 a month in co-payments. 

Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference. Sometimes that shopping takes more time or can feel overwhelming.

That’s why we want to help you take control over your Medicare coverage.  Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>, visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">watch a video about how the Medicare Plan Finder works.</a> After you’ve narrowed your options, you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.

Whether groceries, health insurance, phone plans or anything else, you want value for your dollar.  Make sure you have the most up-to-date information out there.

Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/diabetes-screening.aspx">Medicare covers screening tests</a> so you can find out if you do.

If you’re at high risk for developing diabetes, Medicare covers up to two fasting blood glucose (blood sugar) tests each year. If your doctor accepts <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/a.html">assignment</a>, you pay nothing for this test. You may be at high risk for diabetes if you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, or a family history of diabetes. Talk to your doctor to find out when you should get your free screening test.

If you have diabetes, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home.asp">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a>, including test strips, monitors, and control solutions. In some cases, Medicare also covers therapeutic shoes if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.

Medicare also covers diabetes self-management training to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions. Talk to your doctor about how this training can help you stay healthy and avoid serious complications.

Take control of your health – talk to your doctor today about screening tests and what supplies and training you may need for your health.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you care for someone who is terminally ill? It isn’t always easy to care for a loved one in difficult times, but Medicare can help – you don’t have to do it alone. Medicare covers care for people who are terminally ill, and we have <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/caregiver-topics-support.html">resources to help you</a>.

<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02154.pdf">Hospice</a> is a program of care and support for people who are terminally ill. The focus is on comfort, or “palliative” care, not on curing an illness. Hospice care can include doctor and nursing services, counseling, medical supplies, pain medications, and other services.

If your doctor has certified that your loved one is terminally ill, Medicare covers hospice care, which is usually provided in the home. Medicare will still pay for covered benefits for any health problems that aren’t related to your loved one’s terminal illness. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Coverage/Home.asp">Get more details about Medicare’s coverage</a>.

Remember, you’re not alone – Medicare is here to help. You can also get information about <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/">long-term planning, managing stress, and much more</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicare is ready to help you quit smoking.

About one out of every six cancer deaths in the U.S. comes from lung cancer. Each year, nearly 200,000 Americans are told they have lung cancer and more than 90,000 people die from this disease. Smoking causes 80 to 90 percent of lung cancer cases, so many of these lung cancer deaths can be prevented.

If you haven’t been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, you can get 8 face-to-face <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">smoking cessation </a>counseling sessions during a 12-month period. You pay nothing for these counseling sessions, as long as you get them from a qualified doctor or another Medicare provider.

Talk with your doctor about Medicare-covered smoking cessation programs near you, and visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">smoking cessation</a> page to find more resources.]]></content:encoded>

More than 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have a chronic illness, disability, or frailties that come naturally with old age. Nobody is in a better position than family caregivers to help loved ones manage their health care when it comes to medicines, treatments, diets, and exercise.

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Making the Best Choice for You</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director Center for Medicare</em>

We’ve all had the experience of making outdoor plans for a weekend that’s supposed to be gorgeous, only to cancel when the weather turns out to be 48 degrees and drizzly. Despite our best planning, uncertainty is just a fact of life.

Health can be as unpredictable as the weather. It’s hard to know what you’ll feel like next week, much less what health care you’ll need next year – yet that’s exactly what you need to predict when you’re shopping for health coverage during Medicare Open Enrollment.

We know future needs can be hard to forecast, but taking stock of current circumstances can help. Maybe your family situation is different this year, or you have new health concerns. Maybe you’ve been traveling a lot, so you want a flexible plan that offers coverage in multiple states.

If you’ve recently retired —or even if you’re still working — you may have other health insurance options. If you do, make sure you understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare.

The good news is that now more than ever, you can find a plan tailored to your unique needs. There are better prescription drug plan choices, with premiums that generally have held steady from last year. A full 99% of people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans. Even better, Medicare Advantage Plan premiums in 2012 are 4% lower, on average, than they were this year.

The Affordable Care Act delivered <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">better choices and more benefits </a>to the Medicare program. So no matter which plan you pick, you’ll have access to benefits like these:

• A 50% discount on covered brand-name drugs if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)

• A free Annual Wellness Visit, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy

• A host of preventive tests and screenings — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you

It’s worth it to take a look and compare coverage. We recently learned about a man in central Arkansas who’s had Medicare Part D since 2009. Last year, our State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselors helped him compare his Part D drug coverage with other plan options. They found a new plan that covered more of the prescriptions he needs. The <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder </a>can help you compare plans – check out our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">video on how the Plan Finder works</a>.

So this year, this gentleman has been spending only $18.90 for 3 prescriptions each month — which saves him more than $720 a month. That’s real money.

As you start comparing coverage for yourself, you’ll find Medicare <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">in the mail, on TV or the radio, in the paper, and on your computer</a>. You’ll be hearing so much about Open Enrollment that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.

Remember to keep yourself and your personal information safe [link to blog #4 on fraud when posted]- we’ll <strong>never</strong> call and ask for your Medicare number or bank information, and we’ll <strong>never</strong> come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products. Visit <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">stopmedicarefraud.gov </a>to learn what to do if this happens to you.

While you can’t always predict everything in life, you can do your best to be prepared. Medicare will be there to help you, stronger than ever.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>More Reasons to Say Thanks this November</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

<em>By Julia Eisman, HHS New Media Communications Director. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/11/givingthanks11082011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em>

</div>
<div>Every day we receive letters, emails, tweets and Facebook messages from people around the country that have been touched by the health care law – like a parent whose child is no longer denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition or a senior who has received a 50% discount on prescription drugs.</div>
<div>

There are a lot of ways that the law, signed 20 months ago, has provided significant relief to families throughout the country, easing worries and ensuring that focus is on health, not on fighting with insurance companies over the phone. Chances are, someone in your family is seeing new rights and benefits.

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, during the month of November on our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/healthcaregov">Facebook</a> pages we’ll be highlighting these benefits and sharing some of the stories we’ve heard from people around the country who have been helped by the law. We also want to hear from you, so we encourage you to tell us your story about how you’ve been helped by benefits in the law. Share on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksHCR. You can find us on Twitter at: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">@HealthCareGov</a>.

To give you an idea, here are a few new benefits we have thanks to the health care law:

Thanks to health reform, insurers <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/09/1yearpatientsbillofrights09232011.html">cannot deny coverage</a> to children due to pre-existing conditions.

Thanks to health reform, preventive services will be available <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/index.html">for millions for free</a>.

Thanks to health reform, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/08/women.html">being a woman</a> will soon no longer be considered a pre-existing condition.

Thanks to health reform, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/01/21/voices-health-reform-pauls-story">people with Medicare</a> get discounts on prescription drugs and a free annual wellness visit, AKA more time with their doctor.

Thanks to health reform, young adults under 26 can <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/09/youngadults09212011.html">stay on their parents’ health insurance</a>.

Thanks to health reform, insurers can <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/ratereview10072011.html">no longer raise rates</a> with no accountability.

Thanks to health reform, insurers must spend most of your premium dollar towards your health care instead of on advertising or big CEO salaries. If they don't, they must <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/costs/value-for-premium/index.html">provide refunds to you</a>.

And the list goes on…

Many of the items in the law are common-sense provisions that end the worst insurance company abuses. From new consumer rights like appealing denied insurance claims, to new benefits like prescription drug rebates for Seniors, there are a lot of reasons to be thankful.

Join us on Twitter this November in saying thanks and share your story.

Go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">@HealthCareGov</a>, and let’s get started!

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Extra Benefits &amp; Preventive Services </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center for Medicare</em>

I belong to a gym I really like. It has all the equipment I use – weights, cardio machines, a pool. But what really sold me on membership were the extra features and services: personal training and convenient parking, among others.

Extra benefits can be a big plus in health coverage, too.

A full 99% of people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans in 2012, and these plans often offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover. Medicare Advantage Plans may offer vision, hearing, or dental coverage, or extend coverage while you travel. Most Medicare Advantage Plans also include prescription drug coverage.

Even better, Medicare Advantage Plan premiums are predicted to be 4% lower in 2012, on average, than they are in 2011. <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/08/medicare-open-enrollment-making-the-best-choice-for-you/">It’s worth it to compare</a>.

Folks in Original Medicare will enjoy <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">more benefits</a> this year, too. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, EVERYONE with Medicare has access to a variety of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CMSHHSgov#p/u/9/NxnKxIg2pE0">preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to them</a>. That’s right – no cost.

Covered services include screening tests for colon cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis and heart disease, just to name a few.  Just during the first half of this year, 20.5 million people with Original Medicare got one or more free preventive services through the end of July. 

Medicare also covers an Annual Wellness Visit each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time you need to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones.

To help you track these services, take this <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-checklist.aspx">checklist</a> to your next doctor’s visit. This comprehensive list spells out the Medicare-covered preventive services and lets you keep track of when you got a particular test or service, and when you’re due for your next one.  You also can get preventive service reminders on www.mymedicare.gov.

 Just as you and I might look for different things in a gym, we almost certainly also need different kinds of health coverage. Only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family.

That’s why we want to make sure you have choice and control over the Medicare benefits you’ve earned.  Look around for<a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/"> all the Medicare information out there</a>. And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: 3 C’s for Thanksgiving Dinner</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/22/medicare-open-enrollment-3-cs-for-thanksgiving-dinner/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging</em>

It happens in my family every year during the December holidays: as we push our chairs back from dinner, my aunt asks if she should change her Medicare plan. “I have to do it by the end of December, you know,” she says. 

This year, my aunt needs to make any changes to her Medicare coverage even sooner – by December 7 – because Open Enrollment ends earlier.

If you usually help your loved ones review and compare their Medicare coverage over the holiday season, take advantage of Thanksgiving to have that important talk. If you wait until the December holidays this year, it’ll be too late - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CMSHHSgov#p/u/13/er7-S_eSJwc">Medicare Open Enrollment ends this year on December 7</a>. 

Speaking of Thanksgiving, there’s a lot to be thankful for when it comes to Medicare. Thanks to the health care law, Medicare is stronger than ever, with better <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">choices, expanded benefits, and lower overall costs.</a>

As you gather around the table to help a family member or friend review their Medicare coverage, remember the “3 Cs”:

<strong>       1.    </strong><a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/01/medicare-open-enrollment-looking-at-costs/"><strong>Cost</strong></a><strong>:</strong>  Finances seem to be in the news every day, and on everyone’s minds these days.  Open Enrollment is the time to compare plans total cost –the lowest premium health plan option might not necessarily be his or her best choice overall.

 <strong>      2.    </strong><a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/08/medicare-open-enrollment-making-the-best-choice-for-you/"><strong>Coverage</strong></a><strong>: </strong> While health care needs can be hard to predict, looking backward can help.  Think about the past year of health – does your loved one have new or different health concerns that may require different services and benefits in the coming year?   Look for plans with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.  Rest assured that no matter what plan you pick, the Affordable Care Act provides access to a variety of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxnKxIg2pE0&amp;feature=channel_video_title">preventive services and screenings</a>, at no cost.<strong></strong>

<strong>       3.    </strong><strong>Convenience:  </strong>We hear so much about the “sandwich” generation – those of us who get our children on the bus in the morning, work all day, and stop by to take care of our parents in the evenings.  Your time is valuable, so make sure you and your loved one consider things like office hours, pharmacy availability and whether the doctors prescribe electronically.  A little time thinking about these things now could save you a lot of running around next year.

Our goal by December 7 is that every single American with Medicare has health and drug coverage that meets their needs. So, push back your chair after Thanksgiving dinner and get online - visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a> where we’ve gathered everything you need, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options. Or, visit <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers">Ask Medicare</a> – specially designed for caregivers -- for resources to make your job as a caregiver easier.

If you’d prefer a more personal touch, call or visit one of the thousands of wonderful volunteers staffing the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts/">State Health Insurance Assistance Programs</a> across the country.  I’m thankful for their dedication to helping people with Medicare review their options and find a plan that meets their needs.

This Thanksgiving, I’ll be talking with my aunt about her Medicare coverage, so please take the time to talk to your loved one about their Medicare too.  I know she’s thankful for the peace of mind that Medicare provides.  And I’m just as thankful for all of the information that’s available to help me make sure she’s making the best choice.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Your Time Is Valuable </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center for Medicare</em>

Have you ever gotten a great deal to try a new restaurant or dry cleaner, only to realize that it just wasn’t worth the hassle? Maybe it was on the other side of town, or the hours weren’t convenient, or there were too many exceptions.  We all like to get a good deal, but convenience is a big part of the value.

The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/01/medicare-open-enrollment-looking-at-costs/"><span style="color:#800080;">cost</span></a>, <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/22/medicare-open-enrollment-3-cs-for-thanksgiving-dinner/"><span style="color:#800080;">coverage</span></a>, and <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/15/medicare-open-enrollment-extra-benefits-preventive-services/"><span style="color:#800080;">benefits</span></a>, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:

<strong>Doctor and hospital choice</strong>
You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?

<strong>Pharmacy access</strong>
Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network?  Do they use e-prescribing? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same  pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.

<strong>Travel</strong>
Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.

<strong>Quality</strong>
Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Look for plans with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.

Your time is valuable — and so is your health. The health care law brought <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">more benefits and better choice</a> to the Medicare program, but only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.

That’s why we’re working hard to make sure you have choice and control over the Medicare benefits you’ve earned.  Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>.  And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Millions of Seniors Saving Money on Prescription Drugs, Thanks to the Affordable Care Act</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Nancy-Ann DeParle. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/28/millions-seniors-saving-money-prescription-drugs-thanks-affordable-care-act">The White House Blog</a></em>

Over the weekend, a <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDICARE_COVERAGE_GAP?SITE=WVEC&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">report by the Associated Press </a>detailed how the Affordable Care Act is dramatically reducing drug costs for seniors who hit the prescription drug coverage gap known as the donut hole. This year, seniors are benefiting from a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs in the donut hole. And the discount and other provisions in the law are saving money for seniors. As the AP reported:

The average beneficiary who falls into the coverage gap would have spent $1,504 this year on prescriptions. But thanks to discounts and other provisions in President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law, that cost fell to $901, according to Medicare's Office of the Actuary, which handles economic estimates.

So far this year, more than 2.2 million people with Medicare have saved more than $1.2 billion on their prescriptions. The Associated Press spoke with two of them:

For retired elementary school teacher Carolyn Friedman, it meant she didn't need a loan to pay for drugs that keep her epilepsy under control.

"What a change for the better," said Friedman, 71, of Sunrise, Fla. "This year it was easier to pay my bills, whereas last year I had to borrow money to pay for my medications when I was in the doughnut hole."

…

Joan Gibbs thought her pharmacy had made a mistake. Her total cost for a brand-name painkiller in the doughnut hole came out lower than her co-payment earlier in the year, at a time her plan was picking up most of the tab.

"I reluctantly called the insurance company," said Gibbs, 54, who lives near Cleveland. "If they had made a mistake, I knew they would catch it sooner or later. I was very surprised that it turned out to be such a good discount."

Gibbs is on Medicare because of an auto-immune disorder and other medical problems that left her unable to work.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, seniors will receive bigger discounts in the years ahead. By 2020, the donut hole will be closed completely.

And even if you don’t hit the donut hole, there’s still good news for beneficiaries with Medicare Part D.  Prescription drug premiums <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110804a.html">will not rise next year</a>, and thanks to health reform, seniors can get preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings for free.

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Last Week to Review and Compare Medicare Plans </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>by Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services</em>

With housework, doctor appointments, time with family, and job responsibilities, there are always tasks that get left until the last minute. But whether I’m choosing an insurance plan or planning a vacation, I still want to make sure my “I”s are dotted and my “T”s crossed. I want to know that everything’s taken care of – without worry and confusion.

Speaking of insurance, time is running out! If you’ve been thinking about changing your Medicare coverage, the time to act is now. The dates for Medicare Open Enrollment are early this year to allow for a smoother transition to a new plan.  Not only did Open Enrollment start earlier, but it also ends earlier - the last day for you to change your Medicare plan is now December 7.  This gives Medicare enough time to process any change you may make and have you linked correctly to the plan you choose as soon as your coverage starts. That way you can go to the doctor or your pharmacy on January 1 without having to worry about your coverage.   

If you’re like me, you might use the December holidays to discuss health care options with family or friends. I use the time to talk to my father, who is on Medicare. This year, because Medicare Open Enrollment ends early, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVAPT3m3BZg&amp;feature=player_profilepage">the time to have that important conversation is now</a>.

This year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you have better <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/"> choices, more benefits and lower costs</a>, and it’s worth it to review them. Our counselors worked with a man in Oregon who has saved more than $600 a month on his prescription drugs between benefits from the health care law and lowering his doses.  $600 a month makes a huge difference in helping him pay other bills, and still put some money into savings.

I know that sorting through your health and drug coverage choices during <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment</a> can be confusing but you don’t have to do it alone. 

Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>. We have plenty of resources to help you think about <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/17/medicare-open-enrollment-things-to-think-about-when-comparing-plans/">cost, coverage, extra benefits, and convenience</a> when evaluating your plan choices. And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need online, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options. 

Medicare’s here to help you, stronger than ever. Take the time this week to review and compare plans. It’s worth it - you can relax later.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>As Open Enrollment Ends, People with Medicare save $1.5 billion on prescriptions</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>by Kathleen Sebelius</em>

If you’ve had a Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug Plan for a few years, you’ll know that December is the end of Medicare Open Enrollment.  This year, the last day for you to choose new Medicare health or prescription drug coverage for 2012 is December 7, earlier than it’s been in previous years.

December 7 is tomorrow.  But you still have until midnight tomorrow if you want to make a change  to your medical or prescription drug coverage.

And as you are reviewing your plan, remember that Medicare is only getting stronger. New data released today shows how millions of seniors have gotten cheaper prescription drugs and free preventive services, all thanks to the President’s health reform law.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the donut hole is starting to close. Through the end of October, 2.65 million people with Medicare have received discounts on brand name drugs in the donut hole.  These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of $1.5 billion on prescriptions – averaging about $569 per person.  For State-by-State information on the number of people who are benefiting from this discount in 2011, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Plan-Payment/">visit this page</a>.

Over the coming years, the Affordable Care Act will help close the coverage gap completely. Each year from now to 2020, you’ll pay less for brand name and generic drugs in the coverage gap.  And in 2020, the coverage gap will be eliminated and the donut hole will be closed for good.

In addition to cheaper prescription drugs, the Affordable Care Act also made preventive services available to people with Medicare for free. Preventive care helps people stay healthy and live longer lives. Through the end of November nearly 24.2 million people with Medicare have received one or more free preventive services, including Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit.  For State-by-State information on the numbers of people who are utilizing preventive services in 2011, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/NewMedia/02_preventive.asp">visit this page.</a>

These new benefits are just two ways the Affordable Care Act is making Medicare and our health care system stronger and giving hardworking families the security they deserve. It has helped lower your Part B premium in 2012 by $22.  And, on average, Medicare Advantage premiums will be lower in 2012 as enrollment continues to rise.

And if you haven’t reviewed your Medicare coverage, take time now to compare your current coverage with other options to make sure your plan will meet your health care needs for the coming year.  Medicare now offers better choices, more benefits, and lower costs thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

  <title>Safer and More Effective Dialysis</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Do you or a loved one get kidney disease treatments? Do you ever wonder if you’re getting quality care or what Medicare does to make sure you’re getting quality care? To make sure you’re getting the best quality care, Medicare has a new Value-Based Purchasing “Quality Incentive Program.” This program encourages facilities to provide excellent care, which is best for your health and safety.</span>

<strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Medicare is paying dialysis facilities for providing quality care</span></span></strong>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">When Medicare pays a facility for your care, it expects that care to be of good quality. Starting this month, dialysis facilities that don’t meet treatment standards, or improve from their past results, will have their claims payments reduced. What this means is that facilities have an incentive to provide you with better quality care.</span>

<strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Look for a certificate in your dialysis facility</span></span></strong>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">The next time you visit your dialysis facility, you should see a certificate posted showing how well the facility did in the Quality Incentive Program. Facilities are rated on measures important to your treatment, including:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">management of your low red blood cell count (anemia) by dialysis and medications</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">effectiveness of your dialysis (how much waste, or urea, is removed from your blood)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">You can view a facility’s certificate online using </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Dialysis/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Dialysis Facility Compare</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">, and also see other information including what services are offered, whether the facility has evening hours, and if they offer training. You can use this information to find a dialysis facility that meets your needs.</span>

<strong><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Learn More</span></span></strong>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">The Quality Incentive Program will improve care for all patients. Talk to your dialysis care team about what these results mean for your care. Read about </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Medicare’s coverage for dialysis and kidney disease education</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">, and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Dialysis/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">find a dialysis facility near you</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Are You Ready for 2012? 5 Questions to Ask Yourself</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/01/19/are-you-ready-for-2012-5-questions-to-ask-yourself/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that it’s January, here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2012.

<strong>1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor?</strong>
If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare’s Open Enrollment period and haven’t gotten your new card or welcome packet, contact your plan for help.

If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/MedicareEligibility/home.asp?dest=NAV%7CHome%7CGeneralEnrollment%7CAboutCard&amp;version=default&amp;browser=Chrome%7C16%7CWinXP&amp;language=English#TabTop">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.

<strong>2. Did you budget for this year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</strong>
Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, now that it’s a new year you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies.

This year, the Medicare Part B deductible is $140 – lower than last year! Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible.

<strong>3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</strong>
Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-overview.aspx">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year. Ask your doctor when during the year you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">mymedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.

Medicare also covers 2 new preventive services:
       1. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/alcohol-misuse-counseling.aspx">Alcohol Misuse Screenings
</a>       2. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/depression-screenings.aspx">Depression Counseling
</a>
Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.

<strong>4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</strong>
If not, Medicare has a new way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for this year’s Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.

Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.

You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.

<strong>5. Is your doctor using Electronic Health Records and Electronic Prescribing to provide better care?</strong>
Using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and electronic prescribing can help reduce paperwork, medical errors, and health care costs. These methods can also help doctors communicate better with each other about your care. For example, when you visit a specialist, your primary care doctor can send them your screening information and results. That way, you won’t have to have duplicate screenings and tests. Ask your doctor about what they’re doing to use EHRs and electronic prescribing to better coordinate your health care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/personal-health-records/personal-health-records-overview.aspx">Find out more about EHRs and electronic prescribing</a>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Statement from Secretary Sebelius on American Heart Month</h3>
<em>Crosspost from <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/02/20120201b.html">HHS.gov</a></em>

February is American Heart Month; a month to spread awareness about the importance of heart health. Each year, countless American families are impacted by heart disease and stroke. Although its risk factors can be prevented or controlled, it is still the leading cause of death for all Americans, and accounts for $1 out of every $6 dollars spent on health care.  Fortunately, there are many simple steps we can take to prevent heart disease such as eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and not smoking.

The Department of Health and Human Services is working with both public and private partners to raise awareness of heart disease through vital research investments and public health programs. The Million Hearts Initiative takes aim at this disease, with a goal of preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years. Other efforts, like the HeartTruth, which addresses women’s heart health, and the First Lady’s <em>Let’s Move</em>! initiative, which confronts childhood obesity by helping children choose healthy foods and stay active, work to provide people with resources and ways to make heart healthy changes in their everyday lives .

And thanks to the new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, new health plans must now cover recommended preventive services, including <strong>blood pressure</strong><strong> </strong>screening for all adults and <strong>cholesterol</strong><strong> </strong>screening for adults of certain ages or at higher risk, cost-free.

This month, as we take time to educate ourselves about the risks of heart disease, and recognize the efforts of medical researchers and healthcare professionals dedicated to prevention, early detection, and effective treatment, consider what steps you and your family can take to promote and adopt a heart healthy lifestyle.

  <title>More than 30 million with Medicare used free preventive services in 2011 </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced today that the Affordable Care Act provided approximately 54 million Americans with at least one new free preventive service in 2011 through their private health insurance plans. Secretary Sebelius also announced that an estimated 32.5 million people with Medicare received at least one free preventive benefit in 2011, including the new Annual Wellness Visit, since the health reform law was enacted.

Together, this means an estimated 86 million Americans were helped by health reform’s prevention coverage improvements. The new data were released in two new reports from HHS.

“Americans of all ages can now get the preventive services they need, like mammograms and the new Annual Wellness Visit, free of charge, as a result of the new health care law,” Secretary Sebelius said. “With more people taking advantage of these benefits, more lives can be saved, and costly, and often burdensome, diseases can be prevented or caught earlier.”

The Affordable Care Act requires many insurance plans to provide coverage without cost sharing to enrollees for a variety of preventive health services, such as colonoscopy screening for colon cancer, Pap smears and mammograms for women, well-child visits, and flu shots for all children and adults. The law also makes proven preventive services free for most people on Medicare.

The report on private health insurance coverage also examined the expansion of free preventive services in minority populations.  The results showed that an estimated 6.1 million Latinos, 5.5 million Blacks, 2.7 million Asian Americans and 300,000 Native Americans with private insurance received expanded preventive benefits coverage in 2011 as a result of the new health care law.

The report discussing Medicare preventive services found that more than 25.7 million Americans in traditional Medicare received free preventive services in 2011. The report also looked at Medicare Advantage plans and found that 9.3 million Americans – 97 percent of those in individual Medicare Advantage plans – were enrolled in a plan that offered free preventive services.  Assuming that people in Medicare Advantage plans utilized preventive services at the same rate as those with traditional Medicare, an estimated 32.5 million people benefited from Medicare’s coverage of prevention with no cost sharing.

The full report on expanded preventive benefits in private health insurance is available at <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/PreventiveServices/ib.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/PreventiveServices/ib.shtml</a>.  The report on expanded preventive benefits in Medicare and other ways that the Affordable Care Act strengthens Medicare is available at <a href="http://www.cms.gov/newsroom/">http://www.cms.gov/newsroom/</a>.

  <title>Fighting Improper Payments And Fraud – Protecting Taxpayer Dollars</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/02/24/fighting-improper-payments-and-fraud-protecting-taxpayer-dollars/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</em>

Fighting fraud and waste in the health care system is a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/14/obama-administration-s-unprecedented-fraud-fighting-pays">top priority for the Obama Administration</a>.  We are committed to using all resources at our disposal in these efforts – and they are paying off.

Just last week, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/hcfac/index.asp">released an updated annual report</a> showing that in FY 2011 anti-fraud efforts have recovered more than $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare payments – the second year in a row recovery efforts reached this unprecedented level.  Compare this to just $2.14 billion recovered in FY 2008.  Prosecutions are way up too:  the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 821 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 – nearly a 75 percent increase.

But we know we need keep doing more to end the “pay and chase” model of fighting fraud.  We need to stop fraud and waste from happening in the first place.  Today we’re taking an important step to protect taxpayer dollars by reducing improper payments to Medicare Advantage plans, an action that is estimated to save $370 million in the first audit year alone.  By improving the way we audit Medicare Advantage contracts, we will reduce the payment error rate for the Medicare Advantage program  and that saves money for Medicare.

We are also using new, advanced techniques to fight fraud.  Starting last year, we have been using “predictive modeling” technology – similar to technology used by credit card companies to identify and fight fraud nationwide.  This effort is just getting started but it’s already making a difference. Since the predictive modeling system was activated, CMS has stopped, prevented or identified $20 million in payments through November 2011 that should not have been made.

In addition, predictive modeling has identified 2,500 leads for further investigation, 600 preliminary law enforcement cases under review and resulted in 400 direct interviews with providers who would not have otherwise been contacted.

Predictive modeling won’t reach its full potential in overnight, but it’s already making an incredible difference and will do even more in the weeks, months and years ahead.]]></content:encoded>

Each day, you make decisions about your finances, health, privacy, and more. It’s important to protect yourself and make the best choices for you, especially when it comes to your Medicare.

During National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW), non-profit organizations and government agencies give people like you information on how to take advantage of your rights and make better-informed choices. At Medicare, we’re here to help you become an informed Medicare consumer. Here are 5 things you can do:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Know your rights. </strong>As a person with Medicare, you have certain <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11534.pdf">rights and protections</a> designed to help protect you and make sure you get the health care services the law says you can get.</li>
	<li><strong>Protect your identity.</strong> Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Keep the following personal information safe:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Your name</li>
	<li>Your Social Security number</li>
	<li>Your Medicare number (or your membership card if you’re in a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan)</li>
	<li>Your credit card and bank account numbers</li>
</ul>
Get more information on how to <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/preventfraud/index.html">protect yourself from identity theft</a>.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Help fight Medicare fraud.</strong> Medicare fraud diverts money from the Medicare program each year, which means higher health care costs for you. Learn how to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">spot and report fraud</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Get involved with other seniors with the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP). </strong><a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">The SMP</a> educates and empowers people with Medicare to take an active role in detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Make informed Medicare choices. </strong>Each year during the fall Open Enrollment Period (October 15-December 7), review your plan to make sure it’s going to meet your needs for the following year. If you’re not satisfied with your current plan, you can switch during the Open Enrollment Period.<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
Visit <a href="http://www.ncpw.gov/">NCPW</a> to learn more about the campaign, see which agencies and organizations are able to help you, and to find out if there are any NCPW activities happening in your area.

  <title>Making Medicare claims and benefits statement clearer, simpler</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:Calibri;">As part of National Consumer Protection Week, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Marilyn Tavenner, announced the redesign of the statement that informs Medicare beneficiaries about their claims for Medicare services and benefits.  The redesigned statement, known as the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), will be available online and, starting in 2013, mailed out quarterly to beneficiaries.</span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">This MSN redesign is part of a new initiative, “Your Medicare Information: Clearer, Simpler, At Your Fingertips,” which aims to make Medicare information clearer, more accessible, and easier for beneficiaries and their caregivers to understand.  CMS will take additional actions this year to make information about benefits, providers, and claims more accessible and easier to understand for seniors and people with disabilities who have Medicare.  This MSN redesign reflects more than 18 months of research and feedback from beneficiaries to provide enhanced customer service and respond to suggestions and input.</span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">“Consumer protection starts with making sure consumers not only get timely and accurate information, but that they understand what services they’re receiving from Medicare,” said Acting Administrator Tavenner.  “The new Medicare Summary Notice empowers Medicare’s seniors and people with disabilities.  The statement is easier to understand and navigate, and makes clear what information to check and how to report potential fraud.  The new MSN also makes it easier for people with Medicare to understand their benefits and file appeals if a claim is denied.”</span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">To see a side-by-side comparison of the former and redesigned MSNs, please visit:</span> <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf</span></a> 

<span style="font-family:Calibri;">The redesign of the MSN includes several features not currently available to Medicare beneficiaries with the current MSN:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">A clear notice on how to check the form for important facts and potential fraud;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">An easy-to-understand snapshot of the beneficiary’s deductible status, a list of providers they saw, and whether their claims for Medicare services were approved.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Clearer language, including consumer-friendly descriptions for medical procedures;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Definitions of all terms used in the form;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Larger fonts throughout to make it easier to read;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Information on preventive services available to Medicare beneficiaries.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family:Calibri;">Starting later this week, the redesigned MSN will be available to beneficiaries on mymedicare.gov, Medicare’s secure online service for personalized information regarding Medicare benefits and services; and, in early 2013, paper copies of the redesigned MSN will start to replace the current version being mailed.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.

Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.

Here are some things you can do:
<ul>
	<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
	<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</li>
	<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></li>
	<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</li>
	<li>Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</li>
	<li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</li>

  <title>Could you be saving money?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.

A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.

<strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong>

If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:
<ul>
	<li>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</li>
	<li>Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)</li>
	<li>Qualified Individual (QI) Program</li>
	<li>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)</li>
</ul>
Each program has a different monthly income limit – <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">get more information about the 2012 limits</a> and how to find out if you qualify.

<strong>Extra Help</strong>

Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy">Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>.

You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.

It’s easy and free to <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/i1020/start">apply for “Extra Help.”</a>

Save money, live well, and share the information.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Getting More Accurate Tobacco Information to Consumers</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/getting-more-accurate-tobacco-information-to-consumers/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By: Margaret Hamburg, M.D. Crosspost from <a href="http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/03/getting-more-accurate-tobacco-information-to-consumers">FDAVoice</a></em>

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in our country. And this Administration is committed to implementing strategies that will stop our nation’s youth from starting to use tobacco and also help adults to quit. Today we’re taking <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm297925.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">two critical steps</span></a> forward that will help reduce harm from tobacco and tobacco products.

Americans will soon have more information on the chemicals found in certain tobacco products, reflecting FDA’s commitment to inform and protect the <a title="Less Risky Tobacco Product? Only if the Science Says So" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297895.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">public</span></a>. For the first time ever, tobacco companies will be required to report the quantity of harmful and potentially harmful constituents – <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm297741.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">HPHCs</span></a> – that are in their products to the FDA.

The detailed information that we receive will help FDA determine how best to make science-based decisions to reduce the terrible toll of tobacco-related disease and death. We also hope that by having to disclose this information, industry will voluntarily start to make their products substantially less addictive and harmful.

We are also forging new territory as we seek to ensure that tobacco companies provide accurate information and will not be able to mislead American consumers, especially by making it sound like certain products are less risky than they are. The landmark Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act signed by President Obama gives FDA the authority to ensure the claims for tobacco products marketed to reduce risk or exposure, such as “low tar” or “light,” are truthful and demonstrated by sound science.

So today we issued a draft guidance that provides direction for tobacco companies when they submit applications for modified risk tobacco products – <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm297747"><span style="color:#0857bf;">MRTPs</span></a> – tobacco products that are sold, distributed, or marketed to the public for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease.

We want to make sure <a title="What Are You Smoking (or Chewing or Inhaling)?" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297878.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">consumers</span></a> and the public have an accurate understanding of the health risks of tobacco products—so mistaken beliefs don’t cause them to start or continue using products that lead to preventable disease and death.

We are doing everything that we can to protect all Americans – especially our youth – from the dangers of tobacco, and we’re hopeful these two additional steps will accelerate our goal to make tobacco-related disease and death part of America’s past – not its future.

  <title>Cutting the clutter – the newly designed Medicare Summary Notice</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">It’s a whole lot easier to read and understand your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/m.html#msn">Medicare Summary Notice</a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN), thanks to a recently completed redesign. You’ll see a brand new format when you check your MSN at </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span>

<a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> gives you faster access to your Medicare claims information—you can check it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Customize your MSN to see procedures broken down by single claim, or by a time period you choose, and print out your own statement anytime. Reviewing your MSN online means a shorter wait to see what you were charged for health care services, medical supplies or equipment, and how much Medicare paid.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">We want the MSN to be something that makes it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information.  We spent more than a year improving it. We did one-one-one interviews and focus groups with people like you, and used their feedback to improve the design and language.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">As a recent joint </span><a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/march/07/medicare-fraud-seniors-bills.aspx?referrer=search">Kaiser Health News</a><span style="color:#000000;"> / </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medicare-unveils-new-form-to-enlist-seniors-in-fight-against-fraud/2012/03/06/gIQAy4LqvR_story.html">Washington Post</a><span style="color:#000000;"> article pointed out, we’ve also redesigned the MSN to make it easier for you to help us prevent fraud and find billing errors. Did you know you could get a reward of up to $1,000 for a tip that leads to uncovering fraud? Remember, you’re our best defense against fraud, so check your MSN for services or items you didn’t get.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Here are some of the improvements you’ll see in your new MSN:</span>
<ul>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">Most of us have a friend or relative who has had high blood pressure at some point in their life—it affects the health of approximately 68 million Americans. High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, 2 of the 3 leading causes of death. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">You may even have high blood pressure, so it’s important to get your blood pressure checked routinely. Medicare can help—we cover blood pressure screening as part of your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx">“Welcome to Medicare” visit and your Yearly Wellness Visit</a><span style="color:#000000;">—at no cost to you.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">There are lots of ways you can check your blood pressure regularly, to keep on top of any changes between wellness visits. Check your local newspaper’s events calendar for local senior centers or libraries offering free blood pressure screenings. Visit health fairs that come to your community, where nurses may be on duty to check your blood pressure. Some supermarkets and drug stores offer a free automated machine next to their pharmacies, so why not use it the next time you pick up your prescriptions? You’ll feel good knowing you’re paying attention to an important part of your health.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">May is National High Blood Pressure Education Month—learn more about how you can </span><a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/index.htm#hbp">lower your blood pressure</a><span style="color:#000000;">.

  <title>Let’s be clear: plain writing works</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">Speaking and writing about the Medicare program in plain language isn’t just good practice—it’s the law. The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires us to make sure you’ll find our Web pages, booklets, letters and other materials clear and to the point.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">You don’t have to look far to find examples of plain writing in our publications and on our Web site. Last July we released </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11514.pdf">A Quick Look at Medicare</a><span style="color:#000000;">, an easy-to-read 4-page brochure that sums up what Medicare does, what your choices are, and how you can contact us. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Also, we’ve recently redesigned the </span><a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare Summary Notice</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN) to make it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The Affordable Care Act has also given us new opportunities to reach wider audiences with plain writing. For example, we wrote a plain language overview on the health care law for doctors and other health care providers that was mailed with the February edition of <em>WebMD </em>magazine to more than 175,000 doctor’s offices around the country. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">We’ve made a lot of progress with plain writing during the past 15 months, but there’s still work to do. How do you think Medicare is doing using plain writing in our documents and Web pages? We need to know, so we can make our materials better. Give us feedback on our efforts and learn more about our ongoing commitment to plain writing by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx">CMS Plain Language Web page</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Patient survey results help you choose a home health agency</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator</em>

The day is finally here – weeks after a fall that resulted in a broken hip, you’re ready to go home. You know you’re going to continue to need treatment and services at home, but where do you find a resource to help you through this next step on the road to recovery?

Now there’s an objective and meaningful way to compare other patients’ actual experiences with home health agencies and services—the Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HHCAHPS) Survey – and we’ve just released the first set of survey results on our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> page.

People with Medicare that are getting home health services fill out this short survey that asks about the care they got from the home health agency in the last 2 months, how they’d rate the care, and how strongly they’d recommend that agency.

The initial survey results cover the period from October 2010 to September 2011. Most people who got home health care from Medicare-certified home health agencies during that time said they got the care they needed. In fact:
<ul>
	<li>84% of patients gave their home health agency a rating of 9 or 10 on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest).</li>
	<li>80% of patients said “yes, they would definitely recommend the home health agency to friends.”</li>
	<li>87% of patients said their home health team provided care in a professional way.</li>
	<li>86% said their home health team communicated well with them.</li>
	<li>83% said their home health team discussed medicines, pain, and home safety.</li>
</ul>
By making the results public, we help keep home health agencies openly accountable and continuously working to improve their quality of care.

Let Medicare make it easier for you on your road to recovery.  We can help you make an informed decision when choosing a home health agency that best meets your needs—visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> for the latest patient survey results.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Protect yourself from Hepatitis B </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. Approximately 2,000–4,000 people die every year from Hepatitis B-related liver disease.

The Hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also get infected by coming in contact with a contami­nated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days. Hepatitis B can range from being a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long-term illness (chronic) that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.

The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete protection.

Medicare covers a series of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hepititis-b-shots.aspx">shots</a> for free if you’re at medium or high risk for Hepatitis B. Your risk increases if you have hemophilia (a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally), <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease</a>, or certain other conditions. You may also be at a higher risk if you live with someone who has Hepatitis B or if you’re a healthcare worker and have frequent contact with blood or body fluids. Ask your doctor if these shots are right for you.

May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.

Also, watch our short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNX_mc7S5s">YouTube video</a> about Medicare’s efforts to prevent and treat hepatitis.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you or a loved one hooked on tobacco? Join the millions who’ve found a good reason to give it up—tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths.

If you’re ready to quit, we can help. Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">quit smoking</a>—you pay nothing if your doctor accepts Medicare’s payment.

If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness caused or made worse by tobacco use or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can continue to get up to 8 face-to-face counseling visits every 12 months. You pay your Part B deductible, and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you also pay the hospital a copayment.

Make May 31—World “No Tobacco” Day—your starting point to kick the habit. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking">National Cancer Institute</a> to learn more about tobacco use and how you can overcome it.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you know someone older who accidentally bumped their arm and ended up needing a sling? This type of injury could have been caused by osteoporosis. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and 34 million more have low bone mass. Osteoporosis means your bones have lost density or mass. As your bones become less dense, they become weaker.

People can’t feel their bones getting weaker. So, you may not know that you have osteoporosis until you break a bone. A person with osteoporosis can fracture a bone from a minor fall, or in serious cases, from a simple action such as a sneeze.

While people of all ages and backgrounds can develop osteoporosis, you’re at higher risk if you’re:
<ul>
	<li>White</li>
	<li>Older than 50</li>
	<li>Small in body size</li>
	<li>Eat a diet low in calcium</li>
	<li>Not physically active</li>
	<li>A post-menopausal woman</li>
</ul>
Medicare can help you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best. Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/bone-mass-measurement.aspx">bone mass measurement</a>–it may be free.

Also, take steps to keep your bones healthy. Get the calcium and vitamin D you need every day, and do regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercises.

May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month—learn more about what puts you at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent or treat it at the <a href="http://www.nof.org/home">National Osteoporosis Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>. Also, watch our short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI?" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> about Medicare’s efforts to curb osteoporosis.]]></content:encoded>

Fighting Medicare fraud has long been a top priority for President Obama. Today, we are releasing a new infographic that describes how the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform">Affordable Care Act</a> – the new health care law – is helping the Obama Administration crack down on Medicare fraud and make Medicare stronger. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infographics/medicare-fraud-0512">new infographic</a> shows how the law increases penalties for criminals who commit fraud and provides new enforcement tools to stop fraud and save taxpayers money. 

We are committed to using these new tools to fight Medicare and other health care fraud, and we are getting results:  The Administration’s anti-fraud efforts recovered $4.1 billion in taxpayer dollars last year, the second year recoveries hit this record-breaking level. Total recoveries over the last three years were $10.7 billion. Prosecutions are way up, too: the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 797 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 – a more than 75 percent increase.

Just last week, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice announced “a nationwide takedown by Medicare Fraud Strike Force operations in seven cities has resulted in charges against 107 individuals, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in Medicare fraud schemes involving approximately $452 million in false billing.”  And on Monday, the Departments announced that, as a part of their Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team initiative, they had resolved an investigation into a pharmaceutical company’s unlawful promotion of a prescription drug.  The Justice Department reported that, “the resolution – the second largest payment by a drug company – includes a criminal fine and forfeiture totaling $700 million and civil settlements with the federal government and the states totaling $800 million.” 

The infographic also shows how the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform">Affordable Care Act</a> is making Medicare stronger and providing new benefits. For example:
<ul>
	<li>32.5 million people with Medicare received at least one free preventive service thanks to the health care law.</li>
	<li>People with Medicare who hit the prescription drug donut hole have already saved $3.4 billion on their prescription drugs.</li>
	<li>By 2021, the average person with Medicare will save nearly $4,200 thanks to the new health care law.</li>
</ul>

<strong>By: Lawrence R. Deyton, M.S.P.H., M.D. </strong>Crosspost from <a href="http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/05/national-womens-health-week-the-dangers-of-using-tobacco-products/?source=govdelivery">FDA Voice</a>

The health of every American is of the utmost importance to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.  Our <a title="FDA Center for Tobacco Products " href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/"><span style="color:#0857bf;">Center for Tobacco Products</span></a> works to improve public health, with the goal of making sure that tobacco-related death and disease is part of America’s past, not its future.National Women’s Health Week, May 13-19, provides an opportunity for us to reach out and remind the women in our lives about the dangers of tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke — which claims the lives of nearly 200,000 women every year.

Never starting to use tobacco products and quitting tobacco use – for those who do use tobacco – is proven to lead to longer and healthier lives for everyone.

There is no question that tobacco use is dangerous to women. Just consider a few of the facts:
<ul>
	<li>An estimated 173,940 women die every year due to cigarette smoking</li>
	<li>An estimated 18,000 non-smoking women die every year from exposure to second-hand smoke</li>
	<li>Smoking causes almost 80% of lung cancer deaths in women</li>
	<li>Smoking causes cervical cancer and eight other cancers</li>
	<li>Smoking causes infertility and poor pregnancy outcomes</li>
	<li>Smoking causes low bone density and hip fractures in women</li>
</ul>
National Women’s Health Week is the perfect time for you — or one of the important women in your life — to break a dangerous addiction to tobacco, and for those who do not use tobacco, it is a time to be empowered to never start. Need help? Here are some great resources:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Smoking - Medicines To Help You Quit" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/ucm118667.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">Resources for Women to Help Quit Smoking</span></a></li>
	<li><a title="SmokefreeWomen" href="http://women.smokefree.gov/"><span style="color:#0857bf;">Women.SmokeFree.gov</span></a></li>
	<li>1-800-QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669)</li>
	<li>For the hearing impaired: TTY 1-800-332-8615</li>
	<li>CDC’s Tips from Former Smokers Campaign</li>
	<li><a title="FDA Center for Tobacco Products" href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/"><span style="color:#0857bf;">FDA Center for Tobacco Products</span></a></li>
</ul>
When we spend countless hours taking care of our families and friends, it’s far too easy to forget to look after our own health. This coming week, make an investment in yourself and the women who are close to you by committing to a life that’s free of tobacco-related disease and death.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">Did you know that more than 1 million Americans are living with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, yet approximately 1 in 5 of them don't know it?</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Have you been tested? Medicare covers </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hiv-screening.aspx">HIV screening</a><span style="color:#000000;"> once every 12 months, or up to 3 times during a pregnancy, for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners). You pay nothing for the tests, but you generally have to pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the doctor visit.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Early testing and diagnosis is key to prevention. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Early testing cuts the spread of disease, extends life expectancy, and cuts costs of care. Testing is an important first step in bringing people with HIV infection the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">June 27 is National HIV Testing Day. Make sure your loved ones have been tested—the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime. You can learn more about HIV testing and what you can do to increase testing awareness by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HIVtesting/">Centers for Disease Control</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you or a loved one have cataracts?  A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens that affects vision. According to the National Eye Institute, by age 80, more than half of all Americans will either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.

Medicare can help. Medicare Part B covers cataract surgery, and after surgery Medicare helps pay for cataract glasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lenses you get from an ophthalmologist.

Cataracts often come with age—they affect the vision of about half of all people between 65 and 74. Your risk for cataracts also may increase through long term exposure to sunlight, if you have diabetes, or if you smoke. New eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses may help your symptoms. If not, you may need surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.

June is Cataract Awareness Month. Visit the <a href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/">National Eye Institute</a> at the National Institutes of Health to learn more about cataracts.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Diabetes affects millions of people – are you one of them? Tuesday, March 24 is American Diabetes Association Alert Day – a great time to take the <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/are-you-at-risk/diabetes-risk-test/">Diabetes Risk Test</a> to find out if you’re at risk for developing type 2 diabetes – a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either a lack of insulin or the body’s inability to use insulin efficiently. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults.

Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it, but <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">Medicare covers screening tests</a> so you can find out if you do.

If you have diabetes, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a>, including <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/insulin.html">insulin</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/blood-sugar-test-strips.html">test strips</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/blood-sugar-monitors.html">monitors</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/lancet-devices-and-lancets.html">lancets</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/glucose-control-solutions.html">control solutions</a>. In some cases, Medicare also covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/therapeutic-shoes-or-inserts.html">therapeutic shoes</a> if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.

Medicare also covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html">diabetes self-management training</a> to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Each day, you make important choices about your finances, health, privacy, and more.

During <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncpw.gov%2f">National Consumer Protection Week</a> (NCPW), the first week of March, non-profit organizations and government agencies focus on helping you take advantage of your rights and make better-informed choices.

Medicare has 5 things you can do to help you become an informed Medicare consumer:

1.     Know your rights. As a person with Medicare, you have certain <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.medicare.gov%2fclaims-and-appeals%2fmedicare-rights%2feveryone%2frights-for-everyone.html">rights and protections</a> designed to help protect you and make sure you get the health care services the law says you can get.

2.     Protect your identity. Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Keep the following personal information safe:
<ul>
	<li>Your name</li>
	<li>Your Social Security Number (SSN)</li>
	<li>Your Medicare number (or your membership card if you’re in a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan)</li>
	<li>Your credit card and bank account numbers</li>
</ul>
Get more information on how to <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stopmedicarefraud.gov%2fpreventfraud%2findex.html">protect yourself from identity theft.</a>

3.     Help fight Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud takes money from the Medicare program each year, which means higher health care costs for you. Learn how to <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.medicare.gov%2fforms-help-and-resources%2freport-fraud-and-abuse%2freport-fraud%2freporting-fraud.html">report fraud</a>.

4.     Get involved with other seniors with the <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.smpresource.org%2f">Senior Medicare Patrol </a>(SMP). The SMP educates and empowers people with Medicare to take an active role in detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse.

5.     Make informed Medicare choices. Each year during the fall Open Enrollment Period (October 15–December 7), review your plan to make sure it’s going to meet your needs for the following year. If you’re not satisfied with your current plan, you can switch during the Open Enrollment Period.

Visit <a href="https://owa.hhs.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=ihr8C-E7tE2JkjQSqHaKgss_odF_F9IId0-TfEMT3J6gu_K9rgRcvuBqbuT0VVBo5vjYV2NHoMI.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncpw.gov%2f">NCPW</a> to learn more about the campaign, see which agencies and organizations are able to help you, and to find out if there are any NCPW activities happening in your area.
Also, check out our videos for tips on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY9lmEKlu88">preventing Medicare fraud</a> and see how seniors are learning to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1_mGVPkOdE">stop, spot, and report fraud</a>.]]></content:encoded>

69% of U.S. adults are considered overweight or obese. An unhealthy body weight puts you at a greater risk for many diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer. However, a healthy diet and exercise can help you lower these risks and better your overall health. Not sure how to get started? Medicare can help.

Medicare covers 15-minute face-to-face individual behavioral therapy sessions and 30-minute face-to-face group behavioral counseling sessions to help you lose weight if you have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/obesity-screening-and-counseling.html">Find out if you qualify for this service.</a>

  <title>Saving Dollars Makes Sense, with Medicare</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[With rising prices on essentials like groceries, you’re not alone if you’re keeping a close eye on your wallet. Many Americans are facing financial challenges today, and health care costs are no exception. Luckily, there are many ways you can save money on your health care costs if you have Medicare.

If you have limited income and resources, you may qualify for Medicaid – a joint federal and state program that helps with Medical costs. Even if you don’t qualify for Medicaid, there are other programs that may help you pay for your Medicare premiums and other costs.

<strong>The 4 Medicare Savings Programs are: </strong>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html#qmb">Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html#slmb">Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) Program</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html#qi">Qualifying Individual (QI) Program</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html#qdwi">Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI) Program</a></li>
</ol>
If you qualify for Medicaid or a Medicare Savings Program, you’ll also get Extra Help paying for your prescription drugs automatically. If you don’t automatically qualify Extra Help, you can apply online at SSA.gov.

It's important to call or fill out an application if you think you could qualify for savings—even if your income or resources are higher than the amounts listed on Medicare.gov. These amounts change yearly, and there may be another savings program you are eligible for depending on your specific situation. To find out if you are eligible for savings through one of these programs, call your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Contacts/Default.aspx">State Medicaid Program</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Stay healthy when traveling abroad</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Got your passport? Check. Change of clothes? Check. Trip insurance? Check. Additional health care coverage? What?

You take time checking into airfare, hotels, and sightseeing adventures, so why not make sure you know what your health care covers when you go on vacation?  This is especially important if you’re traveling outside the U.S.

<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/o.html#original-medicare">Original Medicare</a> generally doesn’t cover care you get abroad—however, you <em>are</em> covered if you visit Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, as they’re considered part of the U.S.

If you take a cruise, you may be covered by Medicare if the ship's doctor is allowed to provide medical services under certain laws and the ship is closer than 6 hours away from a U.S. port. Medicare won’t cover services you get if your ship is further away than 6 hours from a U.S. port.

In rare cases, Medicare will pay for inpatient hospital services you get in Canada or Mexico. For example, you may be covered if you’re in the U.S. when a medical emergency happens and a Canadian or Mexican hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat the emergency.

Visit "<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11037.pdf">Medicare Coverage Outside the United States</a>” for more details on what Medicare covers when you’re on a cruise or out of the country.

Also, keep healthy by being aware of local health conditions at your destination. The Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health Web page</a> has health information for travel to more than 200 international destinations. <em>Bon Voyage</em>!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>How We Can Stop Older Americans From Being “Bullied”</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Written By: Ingrid Donato, Mental Health Promotion Branch Chief, Center for Mental Health Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://blog.samhsa.gov/2012/06/27/how-we-can-stop-older-americans-from-being-bullied/">SAMHSA Blog</a>.</em>

Bullying-like aggression can happen to people of all ages – including older Americans. One has to look no further than the situation of Karen Klein, the 68-year-old monitor of Bus 784 in Greece, NY who was tormented by adolescents in a school bus.

Although bullying is typically defined as occurring among youth, what happened on this bus shows that this type of aggression can happen to anyone.  For older adults these problems can occur in many settings, including their homes and long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or assisted living residencesllying can come at the hands of many people in direct contact with elders, including caregivers, family, or even facility residents.

One of the most painful forms of bullying is isolation.

As hard as it is to spot, and sometimes accept, offenders may include family members and old friends, newly developed “friends” who intentionally prey on older adults, and service providers in positions of trust.

While there is no typical profile of an abuser, the following are some behavioral signs that may indicate problems:
<ul>
	<li>Abusing alcohol or other drugs</li>
	<li>Controlling elder’s actions: whom they see and talk to, where they go</li>
	<li>Isolating elders from family and friends, which can increase dependence</li>
	<li>Emotional/ financial dependency on elder; inability to be self‐sufficient</li>
	<li>Threatening to leave or send elder to a nursing home</li>
	<li>Appearing to be indifferent to the child or elder; seeming apathetic or hostile</li>
	<li>Minimizing an elder’s injuries, blaming victim or others for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation</li>
	<li>Threatening to harm a victim’s pet</li>
	<li>Calling the elder and or young person names</li>
	<li>Previous criminal history</li>
	<li>Longstanding personality traits (bad temper, hypercritical, tendency to blame others for problems)</li>
</ul>
Taking time to <a href="http://store.samhsa.gov/product/15-Make-Time-To-Listen-Take-Time-To-Talk-About-Bullying/SMA08-4321">listen</a> and to really “hear” people–of any age—are the first lines of defense against <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/index.html">bullying</a>.  Looking for these signs and carefully talking with the older people in your life can be an important first step in determining whether or not there is a problem.  If you know someone who is being bullied or is a victim of aggressive behavior, there are steps you can take to get the bullying to stop – and the information is available at: <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html">http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html</a>.

If you suspect elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation, visit the <a href="http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/NCEAroot/Main_Site/Find_Help/State_Resources.aspx">National Center on Elder Abuse</a> to find phone numbers for your state, or call the Eldercare Locator at <strong>1-800-677-1116.</strong>  If someone is in immediate danger, <strong>call 911 or the local police</strong>.

Through communication and action, older Americans and people of all ages can free themselves of the risks, torment and trauma of events like what happened on Bus 784.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Spread the Word: Better Health is in Your Hands</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicare has always covered preventive services to keep you healthy, and you already know how important they are. But did you know that your family and friends can also take advantage of them–even if they don’t have Medicare?

Under the health care law, many insurance companies must cover free preventive health services like yearly wellness visits, immunizations, some cancer screenings, and more. Your loved ones won’t have to pay a copayment or coinsurance, or meet a deductible, as long as they get these services from a provider in their plan’s network.

Taking advantage of these benefits is an easy and important way for your family and friends to stay healthy. Preventive benefits can keep them from getting certain diseases, or can help them find health problems early, when treatment works best.

Better health is in your hands–but not just <em>your</em> health. Talk with your friends and family so they can <span style="color:#000000;">join the millions of Americans who are already using these benefits. By spreading the word today, you can help keep them healthy for all those tomorrows you want to enjoy. </span>

Need more information?
<ul>
	<li>         Review a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention">full listing</a> of covered preventive services for women, adults, and children.</li>
	<li>         Talk to your doctor to see which preventive services are right for you.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Choosing quality health care every step of the way</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">It can be a bit intimidating to choose a hospital for surgery or to make plans for when you’re discharged.  Whenever you or a loved one with Medicare moves from one health care setting to another, use </span><a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/">Hospital Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to help you make smooth and safe transitions.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you need surgery, make sure you and your plan of care team find a provider that meets your needs. </span><a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/">Hospital Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> lets you compare up to 3 hospitals in your area to see how they did with different situations, such as giving their surgery patients an antibiotic at the right time to help prevent infection. It will also tell you about patient experience, such as the percentage of patients who reported “yes,” they would definitely recommend the hospital. Next, use our </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/11376.pdf">discharge planning checklist</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to help plan your next steps.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Where will you go once you’ve left the hospital? You might need home health services if your family and friends can’t effectively care for you and you’re not able to leave home without considerable effort. Medicare covers the cost of home health care if you’re eligible and your doctor says you need them. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">You can use </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to see how often a home health agency used best practices when caring for its patients and whether its patients got better in certain important areas of care. Once you narrow down your choices, our 12-point </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/About/FindanAgency/Checklist.aspx">home health agency checklist</a><span style="color:#000000;"> can help you choose an agency that meets your needs. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">In some cases, you and your plan of care team may decide you need to go to a nursing home instead of getting home health services. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home costs. Under certain limited conditions, Medicare will pay some nursing home costs if you need skilled nursing or rehabilitation services. </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> can help you find detailed information about every Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing home in the country. Once you narrow down your choices, use our </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursing/checklist.asp">nursing home checklist</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to help you judge the places you call or visit.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">You and your plan of care team have many important decisions to make whenever you move from a hospital to home health care or to a nursing home. Let our checklists and </span><a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/">Hospital Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> help you make informed choices.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">You take your car for scheduled maintenance service just to make sure it’s fine, right? And, like most of us, you have things like car and homeowners insurance just in case you need it. Shouldn’t you take just as much precaution with yourself to make sure you stay healthy? Keeping your immune system strong is a lifelong, life-protecting job, but we’ve got you covered. Your Medicare </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">preventive benefits</a><span style="color:#000000;"> include 3 shots: </span>
<ol>
	<li><strong><span style="color:#000000;">      </span></strong><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx"><strong>Flu Shots</strong></a><span style="color:#000000;">—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter. <strong></strong></span></li>
	<li><strong>      </strong><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hepititis-b-shots.aspx"><strong>Hepatitis B Shots</strong></a><strong>—</strong><span style="color:#000000;">Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of 3 shots).<strong></strong></span></li>
	<li><strong>      </strong><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/pneumococcal-shot.aspx"><strong>Pneumococcal Shot</strong></a><strong>—</strong><span style="color:#000000;">Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime. <strong></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<span style="color:#000000;">Getting your shots has never been easier. As we approach the fall season, you’ll see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. As long as the supplier or doctor accepts </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/a.html#assignment">assignment</a><span style="color:#000000;"> for giving the shot, you pay nothing.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">You’re way more important than your car or house so make the time to stay healthy.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>You’re not alone - caregivers share their stories</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">Even when it’s a labor of love, caring for an aged, seriously ill or disabled friend or family member can be hard, and you may wonder whether anybody can understand what you’re going through. Actually, <em>many</em> people can relate to your situation—did you know nearly 66 million Americans serve as caregivers? It’s difficult to wrap your mind around a number that large, which is why we created </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/community-stories.html">Caregiver Stories</a><span style="color:#000000;">. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Meet </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/stories-james-patterson.html">James Patterson</a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">. </span>James became a caregiver to his wife on New Year’s Day 2005, after she was hospitalized with complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As with many others in his situation, he didn’t just wake up that day and choose to become a caregiver. “It's a very long process, becoming a caregiver, and you never realize you've begun until you have a chance to reflect.”</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">According to James, being a caregiver is a big responsibility, one that can be isolating. “I think men, in particular, tend to think they can handle everything themselves and are not as comfortable asking for help,” he says. “That's a mistake—it's important to get help when you need it and have support structures in place.”</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">James suggests that caregivers take some time for themselves when and if they can. Two or 3 times a week, he has a caregiving helper come and stay with his wife for a few hours.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">“These breaks are extremely important because I can get chores or errands done or go play a game of golf,” he explains. “As a caregiver, you can never really get away—you're always there. But, if you can find time for something else and get away from your daily routine even for a short while, it can be very rejuvenating.”</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Although the physical demands are great, he also notes the emotional weight that many caregivers carry. “A struggle I deal with as a caregiver is that you don't always get a ‘thank you’ for your hard work because it becomes expected and part of the routine, which can sometimes make you frustrated or angry. However, my actions are just part of our way of our life, so ‘thank-yous’ aren't needed or expected anymore, and when one comes along, it's a really big deal.”</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">His “best advice” for new caregivers: “Be patient and be in it for the long haul. Get as much information as possible and know that people are there to support you.” James describes the resources at </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/index.html">Ask Medicare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and the </span><a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/">National Institute on Aging</a><span style="color:#000000;"> as invaluable. “They cover everything from bathing to hygiene to incontinence. I'm learning something new every day. I can show the materials available to my wife and we can read them together so she can help me help her.”</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If James’ story inspired you or gave you food for thought about your caregiver experience, then please consider sharing <em>your</em> best tips and lessons. Write about your experience and send a photo to </span><a href="mailto:caregiverstories@cms.hhs.gov"><strong>caregiverstories@cms.hhs.gov</strong></a><span style="color:#000000;">–we may add your story to our website!</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you notice something new today? Medicare.gov has a new design that makes it faster and easier for you to answer your Medicare questions.

We know Medicare.gov is your trusted source of online Medicare information.  That’s why we worked more than 2 years improving the things you use most. We did interviews and focus groups with people like you and the people who help you with your Medicare questions to help us find out what matters most to you. And, we used that feedback to make the website better.

The new Medicare.gov includes features not available before, like:
<ul>
	<li>Many ways for you to do the most common tasks, like finding out about costs, coverage, and plans, through several paths — right from the homepage</li>
	<li>Action-oriented labels to help you get the information you want faster</li>
	<li> Design that works on mobile devices, like tablets and smartphones, so you can get information anytime, anywhere, and in the most convenient format for you</li>
</ul>
The new Medicare.gov is just one of our efforts over the past year to make it easier for you to understand your Medicare. Whether it’s putting our information in <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/16/lets-be-clear-plain-writing-works/">simple, straightforward language</a> so you can understand it the first time you read it or <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/">improving the design of the “Medicare Summary Notice ”</a> so you can better understand your Medicare claims,  we’re committed to making Medicare information clearer and simpler.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you had your mammogram this year?

Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it’s the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare covers it at no cost</span></a> if your doctor accepts assignment.

Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening. Take control of your health – better health is in your hands.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Getting outpatient therapy? Be sure you know Medicare’s limits</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Are you getting physical therapy after a hip replacement? Speech-language pathology services after a stroke? Anytime you get outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services, be sure you know the limits for how much Medicare will pay.</span></span></span>

<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pt-and-ot-and-speech-language-pathology.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;font-size:medium;">Medicare helps pay for</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> <span style="color:#000000;">medically-necessary outpatient physical and occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. There are limits, called “therapy caps,” on these services when you get them from most outpatient providers.</span></span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">The therapy cap amounts for 2012 are: </span></span></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;">$1,880 for physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) services combined</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">$1,880 for occupational therapy (OT) services</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">You may qualify to get an exception so that Medicare will continue to pay its share for your services after you reach the therapy cap limits. Your therapist must document your need for medically-necessary services in your medical record, and your therapist’s billing office must indicate on your claim for services above the therapy cap that your outpatient therapy services are medically necessary. </span></span></span>

  <title>Put it on your fall checklist:  Medicare Open Enrollment</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">By: Julie Green Bataille, Director of Communications </span></span></em>

If you’re like me, fall is an extremely busy time of year—getting the kids ready for a new school year, making sure everyone in my family gets a flu shot, getting the house and yard ready for the winter. With everything we have going on, it’s so easy to forget another activity that should be on all our fall checklists: Helping our parents prepare for Medicare Open Enrollment.

Medicare Open Enrollment gives beneficiaries the chance to review their health and prescription drug coverage for the coming year. If they need to make any changes, they can do so between October 15 and December 7. But if they decide that they’re happy sticking with the coverage they have now, they don’t need to do anything else.

For all of us who are caregivers, or who just care about older parents and family members, we need to ensure that they have the right information to make the right choice. Sit down and have a conversation with them, and help them explore their options and find coverage that fits their needs.

If your parents want to go online and sort through the details, they can get an early start, and you can help them navigate the process if needed. We’ve already made sure that the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is fully updated with all new 2013 cost and benefit information for health and drug plans and is ready right now. All your parents need to do is start by entering the drugs and checking on the doctors and pharmacies they want to use. A few more steps will get them a personalized list of their plan choices and help them compare.

Between now and December 7, your parents will be hearing more about the choices, benefits, and lower overall costs they’ll have when it comes to Medicare. We’ll also be adding tips and advice to this blog, to help them you and them consider and weigh choices, and to find places to go to get help if needed.

When Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7, we want every single person with Medicare to have health and drug coverage that meets their needs. But we need your help. We need you to help ensure that your older family members have the right health plan.  So when you’re preparing your fall checklist, don’t forget to put Medicare Open Enrollment at the top.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>By: Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator </i>

 It’s picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today is the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!

In my work with Medicare, one of the questions people ask me often is which plan is the best one. That’s not something I can answer, because picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Each person has a unique set of priorities. How do you weigh your options? Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs.

When you sit down to review your Medicare health and drug plan choices this year, keep track of the things you may want in a plan, and pick one that’s right for you. Here are some things to keep in mind while you consider your choices:

<b>Costs</b>

You should look at your current health care costs to find coverage that works with your financial situation. How much are your premiums and deductibles? How much do you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits? Just like with everything else, the lowest-premium health plan option might not be the best choice for you.

<b>Coverage</b>

Are the services you need covered? We know future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Maybe your doctor changed your prescriptions this year or you have different health concerns. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs.

<b>Convenience</b>

Your time is valuable. When comparing plans, make sure you check which doctors and hospitals you’ll be able to use. Where are they located and what are their hours? Check which pharmacies you can use. Can you get prescriptions by mail? Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.

<b>Quality of care</b>

Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#800080;">Look for plans</span></a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.

 It’s worth your time to take a look and compare coverage between now and when Open Enrollment ends on December 7. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227).  </span>

Only you know what’s most important to you and your family – that’s why I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision. Before you consider your Medicare plan options, think about your personal priorities so you can be sure your plan meets your unique needs.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Diabetes affects millions of people – are you one of them? November is American Diabetes Month and a perfect time to find out about the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html">supplies</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html">self-management training</a> that Medicare covers to help you manage your diabetes. Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">Medicare covers screening tests</a> so you can find out if you do.

If you’re at high risk for developing diabetes, Medicare covers up to two fasting blood glucose (blood sugar) tests each year. If your doctor accepts assignment, you pay nothing for these tests. You may be at high risk for diabetes if you’re obese, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a family history of diabetes. Talk to your doctor to find out when you should get your free screening test.

If you have diabetes, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a>, including test strips, monitors, and control solutions. In some cases, Medicare also covers therapeutic shoes if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.

Medicare also covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html">diabetes self-management training</a> to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions. Talk to your doctor about how this training can help you stay healthy and avoid serious complications.

Take control of your health – talk to your doctor today about screening tests and what supplies and training you may need for your health.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Be a smart shopper</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/10/23/medicare-open-enrollment-be-a-smart-shopper/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>By: Jonathan Blum, CMS Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</i>

In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons, eat out less, or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different. We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. Wouldn’t most of us like to get more and pay less for things that are important to us?

The good news is the health care law has gone a long way toward <span style="color:#000000;">lowering overall costs</span> in the Medicare program. Average premiums for prescription drug coverage and Medicare health plans will stay around the same in 2013. People who are in Medicare’s prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”) will continue to save money in 2013 with big discounts on brand-name prescription drugs. Since the health care law was enacted in 2010, more than 5.5 million people with Medicare have saved nearly $4.5 billion on prescription drugs in the donut hole. 

But you still need to make smart choices to get good value out of your health insurance.

There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage.<span style="color:#000000;"> Ask yourself:</span>
<ul>
	<li>How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles?</li>
	<li>How much will I pay for the benefits and services I’m likely to use?</li>
	<li>Is there a limit on what I’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year?</li>
	<li>Does the plan cover the drugs I take?</li>
	<li>How much will my prescriptions cost under each plan?</li>
</ul>
Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. </span>

Whether it’s groceries, health insurance, phone plans or anything else, we all want the best value for our dollar. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information out there and be a smart shopper during Medicare Open Enrollment – which ends on December 7.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: What’s your back-up plan?</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/10/30/medicare-open-enrollment-whats-your-back-up-plan/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>By: Jonathan Blum, CMS Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</i>

We all like to plan ahead – whether it’s planning for a road trip next summer or planning a big family get-together. Despite our best planning, uncertainty is a fact of life. We always need a back-up plan. What if the car breaks down?  What if it snows on the day of the get-together?

Nobody likes to think of back-up plans when it comes to our health, but health can be as unpredictable as the weather. It’s hard to know what you’ll feel like next week, much less what health care you’ll need next year. But that’s exactly what you need to think about when you’re shopping for health coverage during Medicare Open Enrollment – which ends on December 7.

Even when future needs can be hard to forecast, taking stock of your current situation can help. Review your prescription drug needs, and look for a plan that meets those needs. Plans may vary in what drugs they cover, and some may have special rules that you must follow before they cover a drug.

You may have other health insurance from a current or past job, or through a family member. If you do, you’ll want to understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare. You may decide to keep what you have now – and that’s ok.

It’s worth your time to take a look and compare coverage. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</span>

While you can’t predict everything in life, you can do your best to be prepared. Medicare will be there, stronger than ever, to help.

  <title>Get smart: know when antibiotics work</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>By: Patrick Conway, M.D., Director and Chief Medical Officer, CMS Center for Clinical Standards and Quality</i>

<span style="color:#000000;">As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html"><span style="color:#800080;">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won't work for you?</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotic resistance, caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. These drug-resistant bacteria—which were once easily treatable—can now cause significant harm and suffering. When antibiotics fail to work, we get longer-lasting illnesses, need more doctor visits or extended hospital stays, and more expensive medications.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you or a loved one lives in a nursing home, pay close attention to when antibiotics are prescribed. Roughly  2 out of 3 nursing home residents get at least one course of antibiotics each year, yet nearly 27,000 residents end up with antibiotic-resistant infections each year. These infections are often severe, difficult to treat, and lead to more hospitalizations and deaths among people over 65.  If you have questions, please ask your health care provider.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The CDC has marked November 12—18 as </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">. You can take several steps to make certain you’re using antibiotics properly:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you. </span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later. </span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Not sure if you have a virus, which can’t be treated by antibiotics? </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/campaign-materials/print-materials/VirusBacteriaChart-bw.pdf">Get smart—read this chart!</a><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><span style="color:#800080;">flu shot</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Every year, more people die from lung cancer than any other type of cancer and smoking is the leading cause.

<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;font-size:medium;">Besides being famous for Thanksgiving, November is also Lung Cancer Awareness Month and the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/greatamericansmokeout/index">Great American Smokeout</a>. While you’re making lists for the upcoming holiday season, make a note to talk with your doctor about quitting if you smoke.

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: More is better </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</em>

In this season of Open Enrollment, people with Medicare have the opportunity to choose the Medicare plan that best serves their unique health needs and provides them with the greatest value. In determining the value of a plan choice, you should look not only at premiums and cost-sharing but also at what benefits and quality of care that money will buy. This year, I am proud to say that while costs, by and large, have remained relatively stable, the benefits that people with Medicare will get for their premiums continues to grow.

For those choosing Original Medicare, the benefit package continues to grow stronger and provide greater value. For example, EVERYONE with Medicare has access to a variety of preventive services and screenings, most at no cost to them when furnished by qualified and participating health care professionals. This includes things like diabetes and cancer screenings, and a yearly “wellness” visit. During the first 9 months of this year, over 20 million people with Original Medicare received at least one preventive service at no cost.

Beneficiaries may also explore their options beyond Original Medicare, as virtually all people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans in 2013, and many of these plans offer extra benefits beyond the comprehensive package offered by Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans may offer vision, hearing, or dental coverage, or extend coverage while you travel. And most Medicare Advantage Plans also include prescription drug coverage.

Use this time to decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the Medicare Plan Finder to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area for what will provide you with the greatest value. If you still need help comparing, call 1 800 MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.

Only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you. Just know that no matter how you choose to get your Medicare benefits, you’ll be getting more.

  <title>2013 Medicare update</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><span style="color:#000000;">By: Marilyn Tavenner, Acting CMS Administrator </span></i>

<span style="color:#000000;">We’re now past the halfway point for Medicare’s annual Open Enrollment period, which opened on October 15 and closes December 7. As you and your loved ones with Medicare sit down to consider your options for 2013, we’d like to share the latest news about Medicare.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Our Administration is committed to making Medicare stronger for you and future generations. Thanks to the health care law, everyone on Medicare can get preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings for free. The health care law also makes prescription drugs more affordable for seniors who hit the donut hole. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">These new benefits are making a difference for millions of Americans. 5.6 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved $4.8 billion on prescription drugs since the law was enacted, and during the first nine months of 2012 over 20.7 million people with original Medicare got at least one preventive service at no cost to them.</span> 

These and other parts of the law will result in significant savings. We estimate that the health care law will <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/beneficiarysavings/ib.shtml">save the average person in traditional Medicare $5,000 through 2022</a>.  <span style="color:#000000;">Earlier this year we projected that the standard premium for Medicare Part B (which covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services) would rise by more than $9.00 a month in 2013. Today we announce</span><span style="color:#000000;">d that the actual rise will be lower—$5.00—bringing 2013 Part B premiums to $104.90 a month. By law, the premium must cover a percent of Medicare’s expenses; premium increases are in line with projected cost increases.  Medicare Part B premiums have gone up slowly over the past five years – an average of less than 2 percent a year, or $8.50 total.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Several other changes in 2013 include:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Premium:</b> Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care. Only about 1 percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services—you need to have paid Medicare payroll taxes for 40 quarters of employment or be married to someone who did. For those few affected, the 2013 Part A premium is decreasing to $441, down from $451 in 2012.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Deductible: </b>This deductible is the cost to people with Medicare for up to 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient services in the hospitals for each benefit period (a benefit period starts the day a patient is admitted and ends when the patient has been out of the hospital for 60 days in a row.)  This will increase to $1,184 in 2013, up from $1156 this year (an increase of 2.4%).</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part B Deductible:</b> The deductible will increase to $147 in 2013, from $140. This is still $15 below the deductible in 2011. </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Income-related Adjustments:</b> People with Medicare who report 2011income above $85,000 a year ($170,000 filing jointly) are legally responsible to cover a larger portion of the cost of their coverage.  These premium adjustments range from $42.00 to $230.80 a month for Medicare Part B.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;">As Open Enrollment finishes up and we approach a new year, people with Medicare can be assured they are part of a program that strives to deliver better benefits while curbing costs. And we will continue to do all we can to make Medicare even stronger.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: find comfort in convenience</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</i>

Like most people, I take comfort in the things I’m familiar with. I choose to shop at the supermarket around the corner because I know exactly where to find the things I’m looking for. Sure, I might be able to save a little more money by shopping at a different store on the other side of town, but I choose to stick with what I’m most comfortable. We all like to get a good deal, but convenience is a big part of the value.

The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to <span style="color:#000000;">cost</span>, <span style="color:#000000;">coverage</span>, and <span style="color:#000000;">benefits</span>, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options during Open Enrollment:

<b>Doctor and hospital choice</b>

You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Will your doctors and hospitals accept your current coverage next year? If you’re thinking about changing plans, make sure you check which doctors and hospitals you’ll be able to use. Where are they located, and what are their hours?

<b>Pharmacy access</b>

Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network? Do they <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.

<b>Travel</b>

Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.

We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area. <span style="color:#000000;">If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). </span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you’ve ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer, there’s help. Medicare has a special program called “</span><a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Extra Help</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like </span><span style="color:#000000;">monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan. Did you know that the Extra Help program is estimated to be worth about $4,000 dollars per person, per year? Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Estimates show that about 2 million people </span><span style="color:#000000;">with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of these people?</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">It’s easy and free to apply for Extra Help. Here's how:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Apply </span><a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp">online</a></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Apply at your </span><a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp"><span style="color:#800080;">local Social Security office</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
</ul>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: last chance to review and compare plans</title>

With the holiday season upon us, it’s easy to get busy this time of year. Some pretty important tasks can get left to the last minute. One of those important tasks is ensuring you are in the right health insurance plan in Medicare.  Selecting the right plan is a personal choice, and a lot of thoughtful consideration goes into finding the right match.  But just like the holidays, those key dates come whether or not you are ready.

If you haven’t made up your mind yet about a health or drug plan, now is the time to make your selection.  Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7.  To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/your-medicare-coverage.html?q=plan%20finder">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to review the options in your area. It can help you decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meet your needs and budget. 

If you’re like <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/mycare/stories.html#helen">Helen Rayon from Philadelphia</a> and find yourself in Medicare’s prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”), you will continue to save money in 2013 with big discounts on brand-name prescription drugs.  More than 5.6 million people like Helen have saved over $5 billion on prescription drugs in the donut hole since 2010.

In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now is the time to act and cross another item off your to-do list.

  <title>Are you ready for 2013? 4 questions to ask yourself</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The new year is fast approaching. Here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2013.</span></span>

<b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2013?</span></b>
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment and don’t get your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. </span><a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span>

<b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">2. Did you budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</span></b>
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147. Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2013.</span></a>

<b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</span></b>
<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Medicare covers many </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">preventive services</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;"> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">wellness visit</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;"> and other screenings. You can also use </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</span></span>

<b><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</span></b>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">You can make this change once per calendar year. </span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">.</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;">Remember to check </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;">www.medicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a healthy 2013.</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>At risk for glaucoma? Find out before it’s too late</b>

Do you have diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or are you African American and age 50 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher. With the start of a new year, it’s the perfect time to schedule a regular eye exam to check for glaucoma. You can prevent vision loss by finding and treating problems early.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#800080;">heart disease</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> can.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  </span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease.  Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.  </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Medicare will cover a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/cardiovascular-screening.aspx"><span style="font-family:Arial;">cardiovascular screening</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> at no cost to you every 5 years.  The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.  </span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions.  </span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Luckily, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. The national </span><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Million Hearts</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> campaign</span> <span style="font-family:Arial;">has pledged to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years. You can join them, and get information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">February is </span><a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#800080;">American Heart Month</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">, and a healthy heart is the best Valentine’s Day gift you could ever give yourself, or the people who love you.  </span></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Richard Gilfillan, Director, CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation</i>

It’s the New Year, which means it’s time for those annual resolutions, whether it’s eating right or tackling a new skill.  But none may be more important than making the resolution to get heart healthy in 2013.

Did you know heart attacks and strokes are the first and fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.? The <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/">Million Hearts™ initiative</a>, launched in 2012, is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working with other federal agencies, communities, health systems, non-profit organizations and private-sector partners to help educate Americans on how to make a long-lasting impact against cardiovascular disease.

If you’re at risk for, or are already suffering from, heart disease, now’s the time to practice the “Million Hearts ABCS”:
<ul>
	<li><b>A</b>spirin for people at risk</li>
	<li><b>B</b>lood pressure control</li>
	<li><b>C</b>holesterol management and</li>
	<li><b>S</b>moking cessation</li>
</ul>
Medicare can help you take control of many of the major risk factors for heart disease. People with Medicare can get <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">cardiovascular screenings</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/smoking-and-tobacco-use-cessation.html">counseling to stop smoking</a>, and blood pressure and weight checks during their <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> with their doctor.

Make a New Year’s resolution and give your loved ones one more gift they’ll be sure to treasure—a healthier you in 2013. Help prevent a heart attack or stroke by <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/be_one_mh.html">joining the Million Hearts</a>™ initiative.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bundled payments, DMEPOS, regulatory reform, and ESRD</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</em><i> </i>

In the past few days, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) announced four critical initiatives that are designed to enhance health care delivery for millions of Medicare beneficiaries by improving care or lowering costs, or both.  Taken together the announcements illustrate the breadth and diversity of efforts underway to ensure a better, stronger, more patient-centered Medicare program.

Last week, we announced a new health care delivery system reform, made possible by the Affordable Care Act, to test how bundling of payments for episodes of care, for example a heart attack or stroke, instead of paying for each test or procedure or physician’s visit, can result in more coordinated, higher quality care for beneficiaries.  By bundling payments for services that beneficiaries receive during an episode of care, CMS hopes to encourage doctors, hospitals, and others  to work together to improve care and health outcomes, while also lowering Medicare costs.  Over 500 organizations, nationwide, have already signed-on to participate.

We also announced a major expansion of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program.  In its first year of operation, competitive bidding, where prices are based on suppliers’ bids, saved the Medicare program, and taxpayers, over $202 million, while maintaining access to quality products for Medicare beneficiaries in the nine areas of the country where the program launched.   It’s a great example of the Administration’s determination to put the brakes on runaway healthcare costs.  With this expansion in the program, Medicare beneficiaries in 91 major metropolitan areas will save an average of 45 percent on certain DMEPOS items beginning in July.  Between 2013 and 2022, we estimate that the expansion of the DMEPOS program will save Medicare $25.7 billion, while saving beneficiaries, who pay a percentage for medical equipment and supplies, $17.1 billion through lower prices.

This week, we issued a proposed rule which will help health care providers and hospitals to operate more efficiently by getting rid of regulations that are outdated, obsolete, or excessively burdensome.  Many of the rule’s provisions streamline requirements that health care providers must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, without jeopardizing patient safety, and they will save providers nearly $676 million annually.  Just as important, by eliminating burdensome requirements, health care providers can improve the quality of health care delivery for Medicare beneficiaries by spending more time focusing on patient care and less time filling out forms.

Finally this week, we announced the Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Care Initiative.  It will help identify, test and evaluate new ways to improve care for Medicare beneficiaries living with ESRD.  We’ll be working with the health care provider community to care for a population that significant and complex health care needs.  Through better care coordination, beneficiaries can more easily navigate the multiple providers involved in their care, ultimately improving their health outcomes.

These four initiatives demonstrate that CMS is employing new and novel tools and programs, thinking outside the box and beyond the usual way of doing things, in order to improve health care delivery for people with Medicare and, in the process, strengthen the Medicare program for current and future beneficiaries.]]></content:encoded>

Here are some things you can do:
<ul>
	<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
	<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.

  <title>This spring, put prevention into practice</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The onset of spring is a reminder of new beginnings - the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health.  One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Because preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, it’s a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

<b>Your Preventive Services with Medicare</b>

If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> preventive visit is now covered for free during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.

If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors.  In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colon cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">breast cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">osteoporosis</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">heart disease</a>, just to name a few.

So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive care</a> to ensure you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services
<div id="date_comment_info"><em>Posted March 21, 2013, Crossposted from <a href="http://healthcare.gov/blog" target="_blank">healthcare.gov</a></em></div>
In the three years since the Affordable Care Act became law, the slower growth of health care costs is saving money in Medicare and the private insurance market, helping to curb previously skyrocketing premiums and making Medicare stronger.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that Medicare and Medicaid spending would be 15 percent less -- or about $200 billion— in 2020 than was previously projected, thanks to this slower growth. Medicare spending per beneficiary rose by just 0.4% in 2012, while Medicaid spending per beneficiary actually dropped by 1.9% last year. We are making Medicare stronger, too, by spending smarter, promoting coordinated care, and fighting fraud. Not only does this ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.  It means that those who count on Medicare -- our grandparents, parents, our friends, and neighbors – will have it for years to come.

Today, we are announcing that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 6.3 million seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare have saved more than $6.1 billion on prescription drugs since the health care law was enacted three years ago. This is the result of the law’s closing of the prescription coverage gap known as “the donut hole.”

Nearly 3.5 million people with Medicare saved an average of more than $706 each on their prescriptions in 2012.

In the case of Helen Rayon of Pennsylvania, the savings on her medications is enough to help her contribute to the education of her grandson. She says: “I take seven different medications. Getting the donut hole closed … gives me a little more money in my pocket.” <a title="My Care: Helen R saves on medications" href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A289CvcPdDc" target="_blank">Watch a video</a> to learn more about Helen.

<a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2012/03/mycare_david.html">David Lutz</a>, a community pharmacist from Hummelstown, PA, described his elderly customers, “splitting pills, taking doses every other day, missing doses, stretching their medications.”  But he says this has begun to change with the savings resulting from the Affordable Care Act, and that’s good for their health as well as their budgets.

After the law was passed, the Affordable Care Act provided a one-time $250 check for people with Medicare who reached the Part D prescription drug coverage gap in 2010. Since then, individuals in the donut hole have continued to receive savings on prescription drugs. In 2013 individuals in the donut hole are saving over 50% off of the cost of branded drugs. The savings on both brand name and generic drugs will continue to increase until the coverage gap is closed in 2020.

Along with savings on their medications, American seniors have also benefited from access to vital preventive services -- such as mammograms, cholesterol checks, cancer screenings, and annual wellness visits -- with no Part B coinsurance or deductibles. In 2012, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2013/02/aca-saves-seniors-billions.html">more than 34 million seniors and people with disabilities with Medicare</a> received at least one free preventive service. Having easier access to preventive services without worrying about the cost helps seniors stay healthier and identify health conditions before they become more serious and costly.

Helen works as a health-and-wellness coordinator at a senior center, arranging for health and fitness activities for seniors older than herself.  She knows they struggle with the costs of staying healthy. “If it weren’t for the health care reform, many of our seniors would not get to a doctor,” to get a check up, Helen says. “It is expensive for us to keep good health.”

Affordable Care Act initiatives are also ensuring that if Medicare beneficiaries do end up in the hospital that their care is coordinated and they stay out of the hospital once they’re discharged. This also gives Medicare beneficiaries – and other taxpayers – more value for their health care dollars. In fact, hospital readmissions in Medicare have fallen for the first time on record, resulting in 70,000 fewer readmissions in the last half of 2012.

The Affordable Care Act is helping us keep our moral commitment to ensure that our grandparents and other seniors get the high-quality, affordable health care and security they need and deserve.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We hope every healthcare experience you have is a positive one. That’s why we offer you a variety of tools to express your concerns. One of those tools is the ability to file a complaint (sometimes called a “grievance”).

<b>Do you have a complaint?</b>

If you have a concern or a problem that isn’t a request for coverage or reimbursement, you have the right to file a complaint. Not sure if you need to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/index.html">file a complaint or an appeal</a>? Read some <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/complaints.html">examples of situations</a> where you might need to file a complaint.

<b>Things to know before you file a complaint:</b>

Each plan has specific rules you’ll need to know and follow when filing a complaint.  If, after filing a complaint, your plan doesn’t address the issue, call 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance. You can also call your <a href="https://medicare.gov/Contacts/Default.aspx">State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)</a> for free, personalized help filing a complaint.

<b>Information you’ll need to have ready when you file a complaint:</b><b> </b>

<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Basic information about you </span></b>
<ul>
	<li>First and last name</li>

	<li>State you live in</li>
	<li>Zip code</li>

&nbsp;

<b>2 tools Medicare offers that can help…</b>

1. A <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/personal-health-records/personal-health-records.html">Personal Health Record</a> (PHR) is a record with information about your health that you, or someone helping you, can keep for easy reference using a computer. You control the health information in your PHR and can get to it anywhere, at any time, with Internet access.

2. The <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/blue-button/medicare-blue-button.html">Blue Button</a> tool provides you an easy way to download your personal health information to a file. You can download the file of your personal data and save the file on your own personal computer.  You can access the Blue Button through your account on <a href="https://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you keep putting off exercise? You may be hurting your bones. Lack of exercise is one of the risk factors that can lead to osteoporosis. When people have osteoporosis their bones become less dense. You may not know that you have osteoporosis until your bones are so weak that a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes your wrist to break or your hip to fracture.

Medicare can help you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best. Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.

May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. Learn more about what puts you at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent or treat it at the <a href="http://www.nof.org/">National Osteoporosis Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>. Watch our short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI">video</a> to learn more about how Medicare can help you protect your bones.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Say "no" to tobacco!</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/05/31/say-no-to-tobacco/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This year include tobacco in your annual spring cleaning, and kick those cigarette butts in the, well, butt!  Why? Because tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths. If you or someone you love is ready to quit smoking, we can help.

<b>Medicare can help you quit smoking</b>

Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">quit smoking</a>. If you haven't been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, and if the doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment, then you pay nothing for the counseling sessions.

If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness that was caused or made worse by tobacco use, or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can still get up to 8 counseling sessions every 12 months. In this case, you pay your Part B deductible and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. (If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you’ll also need to pay the hospital a copayment.)

<b>Let’s get started!</b>

Bring out the trash bags and the brooms – it’s time for a clean start this spring. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking">National Cancer Institute</a> to learn more about how you can quit smoking.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic Hepatitis B, but many more people don’t know they’re infected because they have no symptoms? Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</p><p>Medicare can help keep you protected from Hepatitis B. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete coverage. If you’re at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B, Medicare Part B will cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a> for free.</p><p>Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? If you have hemophilia, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</a>, diabetes, or certain conditions that lower your resistance to infection, you have a higher risk for getting Hepatitis B increases.  Additionally, if you have a profession that puts you in frequent contact with blood or bodily fluids, you may be at a higher risk.</p><p>May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you or does someone you know have high blood pressure? Most likely, your answer is yes. More than one-third of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, and many don’t even know it. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart disease, the #1 killer worldwide, and many other diseases. That’s why it’s important to get your blood pressure checked regularly.

Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy. A blood pressure screening is covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare” visit</a> and your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness visit</a> at no cost to you.

There are also many ways to prevent and help treat high blood pressure. Eating a healthy diet and avoiding sodium are easy ways to lower blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active are also important. The surgeon general recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. You can also check your blood pressure between your yearly visits for free at many pharmacies, senior centers, and health fairs.

May is National High Blood Pressure Education Month, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI">our video</a> to learn more.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re planning a vacation this summer, you know there’s a lot to do before your leave – like buy sunscreen, book your flight, and renew your passport. Don’t forget to include 2 very important items on your travel to-do list if you plan to leave the country on your trip:
<ol>
	<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
	<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
You have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., which includes Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. But, if you plan to travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know if your Medicare coverage will be different.

In most cases, Medicare won’t pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.

Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.

Figuring out your health care coverage will help you be prepared so you can have a stress-free trip. To be even more prepared for your vacation, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a> for more information on how to stay healthy abroad.]]></content:encoded>

<!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;-->
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18pt;background:white;"><span style="color:#111111;">By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">With today’s regulation limiting overhead and profits for Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans, the Affordable Care Act continues to promote value for consumers’ and taxpayers’ health care spending. These new requirements apply to Medicare health and drug plans offered by private insurance companies serving over 37 million seniors and persons with disabilities, and build on a similar regulation we issued last year requiring a minimum medical loss ratio for health plans serving consumers in the private insurance market. Medicare health and drug plans, beginning next year, must meet a minimum medical loss ratio, limiting their spending on non-health related items such as administrative costs, profit, or overhead. More specifically, this means that the plans must spend at least 85 percent of their revenue on direct benefits to Medicare enrollees such as clinical services, prescription drugs and quality improving activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">The new Medicare MLR requirements will also give people with Medicare and their caregivers more information about Medicare plans when comparing their health care options during enrollment periods. They will be able to consider a plan’s medical loss ratio, along with quality ratings, coverage, premiums and other factors that influence their health care decisions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">By ensuring that plan payments are spent on health care and activities that improve the quality of care received, seniors and persons with disabilities will have more opportunities to work with their doctors and other health care professionals to stay healthy. With Medicare spending already growing at a slower pace, the new requirements are just one more way the Affordable Care Act is creating more value for seniors and persons with disabilities. We are excited about new initiatives and projects that are improving the health of people with Medicare and are committed to making a stronger Medicare program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever been tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)? More than 1 million Americans are infected with HIV, yet approximately 1 in 5 of them don't know it.

Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).

Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.

Visit Health &amp; Human Services’ <a href="http://aids.gov/">Aids.gov</a> website to learn about <a href="http://aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/hiv-testing-day/">National HIV Testing Day</a>, June 27.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you ever put off doing a task or getting a test and later wished you’d just gotten it over with? If you’re a man with Medicare, now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should get screened for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/prostate-cancer-screening.aspx">prostate cancer</a>, for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer</a>, or for both. Screening tests can find cancer early, when treatment works best.

Don’t worry about the cost—if you’re a man 50 or over, Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 month. Also, Medicare covers a variety of colorectal cancer screenings, and you pay nothing for most tests.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of cancer deaths. Not sure you should get screened? You’re at a higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.

Colorectal cancer is also common among men—in fact, it’s the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men <i>and</i> women. If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, we could avoid as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer.

In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer. If you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues, make sure you get screened regularly for colorectal cancer.

June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life. Watch our videos on how Medicare has you covered on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcM0wptOIJg">prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPJp3VYdfg">colorectal cancer</a> screenings, and visit the Centers for Disease Control for more information on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HealthyMen/">men’s health</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you taking precautions to make sure you stay healthy?  Just like you take your car for scheduled maintenance, it’s important to do what you can to take care of your body.  Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a>, and we make it easy for you to get these 3 shots:
<ol>
	<li><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><b>Flu Shots</b></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter.<b> </b></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html"><b>Hepatitis B Shots</b></a><b>—</b>Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of 3 shots).</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pneumococcal-shots.html"><b>Pneumococcal Shot</b></a><b>—</b>Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime.</li>
</ol>
As we approach the fall, you’ll see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. You pay nothing as long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot.

A strong immune system is way more important than your car, so make the time to stay healthy and take a few minutes to watch our video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncDOTyjryWo">National Immunization Awareness Month</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can expect to hear more about Medicare. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment, and it’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you’re happy sticking with the plan you have.

This year, you may hear a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace. The <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period (October 1, 2013–March 31, 2014) overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period (October 15–December 7, 2013). The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> the<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>Marketplace<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>won’t have any effect on your Medicare<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>coverage</span></a>.

Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:

<b>1. In the mail</b>

Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">extra help</span></a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.

Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare &amp; You</span></a> handbook. Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">go paperless</span></a>,”<span style="color:#000000;"> you’ll get an email pointing you to </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> where you can get all the same information.</span>

You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</span></a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you. And, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.

<b>2.     </b><b>On your computer </b>

Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> is ready with all of the 2014 cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review the plan’s <span style="color:#000000;">ratings</span> to compare plan quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34"><span style="color:#0000ff;">video</span></a> to help you get started.

<b>3.     </b><b>In newspapers, magazines, TV and radio</b>

Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to tune into the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts"><span style="color:#0000ff;">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</span></a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!

Now’s the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: time to pick a plan </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today is the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!

Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:

<b>Does the plan cover the services you need? </b>

Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">how that coverage works with Medicare</span></a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?

No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Affordable Care Act</span></a> like these:
<ul>
	<li>A discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
	<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yearly “wellness” visit</span></a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
	<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">preventive tests and screenings</span></a> — including cancer screenings —  most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<b>What’s the cost? </b>

The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.

<b>How about convenience? </b>

Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">electronic health records</span></a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">prescribe electronically</span></a>? Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.

Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: shop around</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons, eat out less, or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy.

Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different. We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. But you still need to make smart choices to get good value out of your health insurance.

There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage.How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year?

Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan?  Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span>

Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help.

The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs. <span style="color:#000000;">After you’ve narrowed your options</span>,<span style="color:#000000;"> you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.</span>

Whether groceries, health insurance, phone plans or anything else, you want value for your dollar.  Make sure you have the most up-to-date information out there.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: more is better</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/10/29/more-is-better/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Going through the process of buying a new computer or tablet takes a bit of elbow grease, but when the salesman throws in free accessories and tech support, it’s worth it. Not only are the free accessories fun, but there’s a peace of mind knowing that the support you’ll need is free.

Extra benefits and peace of mind can be a big plus in health coverage, too.

You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> the<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>Marketplace<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>won’t have any effect on your Medicare<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>coverage</span></a>.

If you have Medicare, you’re not affected by the Marketplace, but you still get to enjoy extra benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Affordable Care Act</span></a> like these:
<ul>
	<li>A discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
	<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">preventive tests and screenings</span></a> — including cancer screenings —  most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
Medicare also covers a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yearly wellness exam</span></a> each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones. You can keep track of your preventive services and get reminders for them at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a>.

Also, most people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans, and many of these plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover like vision, hearing, dental coverage, prescription drugs, or extended coverage when you travel.

Just like deciding between a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer, only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family.

During Medicare Open Enrollment, decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: convenience matters </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever pumped gas into your car from a station just around the corner from home even though it’s a bit more expensive than the one in town? Most of us have made decisions to do or not do something based on convenience.

The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to cost, coverage, and benefits, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:

<b>Doctor and hospital choice</b>

You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?

<b>Pharmacy access</b>

Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network?  Do they use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">e-prescribing</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.

<b>Travel</b>

Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.

<b>Quality</b>

Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/when-can-i-join-a-health-or-drug-plan/five-star-enrollment/5-star-enrollment-period.html">Look for plans with a 5‑star performance</a> rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.

Your time is valuable — and so is your health. Only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.

We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: 4 ways to protect your identity and information</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/11/12/medicare-open-enrollment-4-ways-to-protect-your-identity-and-information/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Guard your information.</li>
	<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
	<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
	<li>If you spot something, say something.</li>
</ol>
These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard.

During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about Medicare. You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period.

The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>. In fact,<b> it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan</b>.

Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make sure you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes.

Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:

<b>1.     </b><b>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards.</b>

You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.

It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <b>never</b> call and ask for this information, and we will <b>never</b> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.   And remember, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.

2. <b>Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</b>

Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!

<b>3.     </b><b>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</b>

If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <b>don’t</b> give them your Medicare number.

4. <b>Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</b> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).

Learn more at <a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/xa55/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/M95LQ2NH/stopmedicarefraud.gov">stopmedicarefraud.gov</a>. Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: time’s running out  </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It feels like “to do” lists are everywhere these days – on a pad of paper on the kitchen table, in email, or in an app on a smart phone.  If you still have “Review Medicare coverage” on your to do list, time is running out!

Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.

Remember, the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>.

In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act and cross another item off your to do list.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Celebrating 30 years of Hospice care</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[November 2013 marks the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Medicare coverage for Hospice care. That’s right, for 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones.

Hospice is a program of care and support for people who are terminally ill. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness. Hospice care is generally provided in the home, by a specially trained team of professionals and caregivers. Services may include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related condition(s).

For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your <a href="http://medicare.gov/contacts/">state hospice organization</a>.

Here’s to 30 more years of providing the comfort, care, and support that you and your family deserve during this difficult time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Get smart about using antibiotics</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/11/18/antibiotics/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won’t work for you?</a> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply. These resistant germs lead to severe infections, hospitalizations, and death - especially among people over 65.

The CDC has marked this week as <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</a>. Here are 3 things you can do to make sure you're using antibiotics properly:

1. Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you.

2. Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.

3. Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later.

Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html">flu shot</a>! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Is your Medicare ready for 2014?</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/12/09/ready-for-2014/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The new year is fast approaching. Here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2014.

<b>1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2014?</b>
If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment and don’t get your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</a>.

If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.

<b style="line-height:1.5;">2. Did you budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</b>

Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2013. Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2014.</a>

<b style="line-height:1.5;">3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</b>

Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.

Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.

<b style="line-height:1.5;">4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</b>

If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:Arial;">heart disease</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> can.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  </span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease.  Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.  </span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Medicare will cover a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html"><span style="font-family:Arial;">cardiovascular screening</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> at no cost to you every 5 years.  The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.  </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions.  You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy. </span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Luckily, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. The national </span><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Million Hearts</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> campaign</span> <span style="font-family:Arial;">has pledged to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. You can join them, and get information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.</span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;">February is </span><a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">American Heart Month</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">, and a healthy heart is the best Valentine’s Day gift you could ever give yourself, or the people who love you.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Join the fight against Medicare fraud</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Here are some things you can do:</span></span></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">Guard your Medicare and Social Security Numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security Number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:medium;">Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check MyMedicare.gov, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;">Learn more</span></a><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> about spotting and reporting fraud, and get tips on protecting yourself from identity theft.</span></span></span>

Tuesday, March 25 is </span>American Diabetes Association Alert Day – a great time to take the <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/are-you-at-risk/diabetes-risk-test/">Diabetes Risk Test</a> to find out if you’re at risk for developing type 2 diabetes - a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either a lack of insulin or the body's inability to use insulin efficiently. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults. <span style="color:#000000;">Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it, but </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">Medicare covers screening tests</a><span style="color:#000000;"> so you can find out if you do.  </span></span></span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you have diabetes, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a><span style="color:#000000;">, including test strips, monitors, and control solutions. In some cases, Medicare also covers therapeutic shoes if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Medicare also covers </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html">diabetes self-management training</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions. Talk to your doctor about how this training can help you stay healthy and avoid serious complications.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Take control of your health – talk to your doctor today about screening tests and what supplies and training you may need for your health.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>This spring, put prevention into practice</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/03/24/spring-prevention/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;">The start of spring is a reminder of new beginnings – the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health. One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Because preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, it’s a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;"><b>Your preventive services with Medicare</b></span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a><span style="color:#000000;"> preventive visit is now covered for free during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors. In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">diabetes</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colon cancer</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">breast cancer</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">osteoporosis</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">heart disease</a><span style="color:#000000;">, just to name a few.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive care</a><span style="color:#000000;"> so you can you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.</span>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[ “Risky drinking” is defined as more than 21 drinks per month according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Geriatrics Society. Did you know that 9% of people with Medicare drink more than 30 drinks a month?

There are lots of changes that happen with age, and some of them, like physical pain, loss of mobility, and loneliness can lead to alcohol misuse.  Drinking too much alcohol increases your risk of injuries, violence, drowning, liver disease, bad interactions with medications, and some types of cancer. 

April is Alcohol Awareness Month, and it’s the perfect time to remind you that Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/alcohol-counseling.html">alcohol misuse screening &amp; counselling</a> to provide counselling for people who misuse alcohol.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Will a silent disease shatter your life?  Every year, a growing number of Americans are finding out that they have osteoporosis-a disease that causes bones to weaken and be more likely to break.  Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">can help</a> you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best.  Learn the facts so you can protect your bones!

Many people believe:
<ul>
	<li>Osteoporosis is a natural part of aging that only affects older women</li>
	<li>Bone loss can’t be treated once it starts</li>
	<li>The only risk of osteoporosis is broken bones from falls</li>
</ul>
None of these myths are true.  What is true is:
<ul>
	<li>While 1 in 3 women over 50 will develop osteoporosis, 1 in 5 men will, too</li>
	<li>It is possible to make bones stronger</li>
	<li>Around 25 % of people die within the first 6 to 12 months after a hip fracture</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent or lessen the severity of osteoporosis.  Making sure you get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise are 3 important ways to make your bones stronger.  May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.  Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you have a minute to keep your heart and kidneys healthy?  Getting a fast (less than a minute) and simple test can tell you if your blood pressure is too high.  High blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms, but it can lead to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.  Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy because it’s covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness </a> visits at no cost to you.

If you have high blood pressure, you can control it with lifestyle changes and medicine.  You may be at risk for high blood pressure if you:
<ul>
	<li>Smoke</li>
	<li>Eat salty foods</li>
	<li>Don’t exercise enough</li>
	<li>Drink more than a moderate amount of alcohol</li>
	<li>Have a family history of high blood pressure</li>
	<li>Are overweight</li>
</ul>
May is National High Blood Pressure Awareness Month, so get tested and keep your heart and kidneys healthy!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Reminders to take care of your physical health are all around you– on the web, in television ads, and from concerned family members. What you may not remember is that taking care of your mental health is just as important! May is National Mental Health Month, so we’re making an effort to spread the word about all of the mental health resources available to people with Medicare.

Medicare helps cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/outpatient-mental-health-care.html">outpatient</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/inpatient-mental-health-care.html">inpatient</a> mental health care, as well as <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/partial-hospitalization-mental-health-care.html">partial hospitalization</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/depression-screenings.html">screenings for depression</a>. If you have Medicare prescription drug coverage, you can also get medications to help treat a mental health condition.

<a href="http://www.mentalhealth.gov/">Mental health</a> includes your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. If you experience mental health problems your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.

- Mental health problems are common and can be caused by many factors:

- Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry

- Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse

- Family history of mental health problems

&nbsp;

<strong>Remember: </strong> taking care of your health is about more than just your physical health – it’s about taking care of all of you! Medicare is here to help you take care of your mental health, and remind you that <strong>you’re not alone</strong> -- we’re here to support you.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<header class="entry-header"><!-- .entry-header -->Did you know that 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic Hepatitis B, but many more people don’t know they’re infected because they have no symptoms? Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</header>
<div class="entry-content post_content">

Medicare can help keep you protected from Hepatitis B. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete coverage. If you’re at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B, Medicare Part B will cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a> for free.

Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? If you have hemophilia, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</a>, diabetes, or certain conditions that lower your resistance to infection, you have a higher risk for getting Hepatitis B increases. Additionally, if you have a profession that puts you in frequent contact with blood or bodily fluids, you may be at a higher risk.

May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.

  <title>Traveling abroad this summer? Plan a worry-free vacation.</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/06/02/travel/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re planning a vacation abroad this summer, you already know that there’s a lot to do before you leave. There are suitcases to pack, an itinerary to plan, and perhaps a passport to renew. We want you to have the most relaxing vacation possible, so before you go don’t forget to:
<ol>
	<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
	<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
You already have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands). When you travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know how your Medicare works.

In most cases, Medicare <strong>won’t</strong> pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.

Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.

Taking the time to plan out your health care coverage before you travel abroad will help you to have an enjoyable and relaxing trip. For more information on how to stay healthy abroad, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you the type of guy who puts off doing a task and later wishes he’d just done it? If you’re a man with Medicare, now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should get screened for<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/prostate-cancer-screenings.html">prostate cancer</a>, for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer</a>, or for both.

Don’t put off screenings if you’re worried about the cost: Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 months if you’re a man with Medicare who’s 50 or over. Also, Medicare also covers several types of colorectal cancer screenings, and you pay nothing for most tests.

Did you know prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of total male cancer deaths? You’re at higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.

Colorectal cancer is also common among men—in fact, it’s the third most commonly diagnosed cancer diagnosed in both men <strong>and</strong> women in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer.

Your risk of getting colorectal cancer goes up as you age. If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, we could avoid as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer. Make sure you get screened regularly for colorectal cancer if you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues.

June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life. Watch our videos on how Medicare has you covered on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcM0wptOIJg">prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPJp3VYdfg">colorectal cancer</a> screenings, and visit the Centers for Disease Control for more information on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/men/index.htm">men’s health</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Take charge, take the test for HIV</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know that approximately 1 in 5 of the more than 1 million Americans infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) don't know they’re carrying the virus?

Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).

HIV is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.

  <title>Medicare protects you on World Hepatitis Day and every day</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know that hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by a virus, affects millions of people worldwide, resulting in acute and chronic liver disease and killing close to 1.4 million people every year?

Hepatitis is contagious. For example, the Hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also get infected by coming in contact with a contami­nated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days. Hepatitis B can range from being a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long-term illness (chronic) that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.

Medicare can help keep you protected from some of the common strains of hepatitis: Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.

Generally, Medicare Part D (<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html">prescription drug coverage</a>) covers Hepatitis A shots when medically necessary.

Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a>, which usually are given as a series of 3 shots over a 6-month period (you need all 3 shots for complete protection).

There’s a third type of Hepatitis—Hepatitis C. Medicare covers a one-time Hepatitis C screening test if your primary care doctor or practitioner orders it and you meet one of these conditions:
<ul>
	<li>You’re at high risk because you have a current or past history of illicit injection drug use</li>
	<li>You had a blood transfusion before 1992, or</li>
	<li>You were born between 1945 and 1965</li>
</ul>
July 28 is World Hepatitis Day. Find out how you can prevent and treat hepatitis by visiting the World Health Organization’s <a href="http://www.who.int/campaigns/hepatitis-day/2014/en/">World Hepatitis Day web page</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment is coming soon – do you need to make a change?  </title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/10/01/medicare-open-enrollment-is-coming-soon-do-you-need-to-make-a-change/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can already see the leaves starting to change. Like the changing leaves, the fall also brings your chance to make changes to your Medicare coverage. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment. It’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. Or, you may decide you’re happy with the plan you have now. If that’s the case, and the plan is still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything.

Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:

<strong>1. In the mail</strong>

Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a title="Extra Help" href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.

Also, look for your Medicare &amp; You handbook. It contains information about all of the Medicare plans in your area. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx">go paperless</a>,” you’ll get an email pointing you to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html">Medicare.gov</a> where you can get all the same information.

You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you.

<strong>2. On your computer </strong>

Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is ready with all of the 2015 health and drug plan cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs and review the plan’s ratings to compare plan quality. If you find a plan that meets your needs, you’ll be able to join the plan right online starting October 15. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34">video</a> to help you get started.

<strong>3. In your community</strong>

Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to review the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This helps to detect breast cancer early, when it’s most treatable. All women over 40 should have a mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">Medicare covers it at no cost</a> if your doctor accepts assignment. Talk to your doctor about risk factors and to schedule your next screening.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you getting physical therapy after a hip replacement? Speech-language pathology services after a stroke? Anytime you get outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services, be sure you know the limits for how much Medicare will pay.

Medicare helps pay for medically-necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. There are limits, called “therapy caps,” on these services when you get them from most outpatient providers.

The therapy cap limits for 2014 are:
<ul>
	<li>$1,920 for physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) services combined</li>
	<li>$1,920 for occupational therapy (OT) services</li>
</ul>
You may qualify to get an exception so that Medicare will continue to pay its share for your services after you reach the therapy cap limits.

  <title>Cutting-edge colorectal cancer screening now covered</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men and women? More than 90% of cases occur in people who are 50 years old or older. More men than women get colon cancer, and 1 or 2 out of every 100 men who are 60 today will develop colon cancer by age 70.

Starting today, people with Medicare who don’t show symptoms of colorectal cancer will have access to the Cologuard™ multi-target stool DNA test, a first-of-its-kind test. It’s being covered more quickly than usual by Medicare through a pilot program run jointly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Medicare. Medicare and the FDA are working together to get you state-of-the-art treatments faster.

In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Cologuard™ studies a patient’s stool sample to see if there’s DNA code that suggests either the presence of precancerous polyps or colorectal cancer. This way, your doctors can find these polyps and you can get them removed before they turn into cancer.

Medicare Part B covers the Cologuard™ test <strong>once every 3 years</strong> for people with Medicare who meet <strong>all</strong> of these conditions:
<ul>
	<li>Between 50 and 85 years old</li>
	<li>Show no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, and</li>
	<li>At average risk of developing colorectal cancer—have no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; and have no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</li>
</ul>
Cologuard™ is one of several tools that Medicare covers to detect colorectal cancer. Talk with your doctor about which <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer screenings</a> you should try.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Are you ready to pick a plan?</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Fall is picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today’s the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!

Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and to pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:

<strong>Does the plan cover the services you need? </strong>

Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html">how that coverage works with Medicare</a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?

No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:
<ul>
	<li>A discount of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
	<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly “wellness” visit</a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
	<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<strong>What’s the cost? </strong>

The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.

<strong>How about convenience? </strong>

Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html">electronic health records</a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>?

<strong>Quality is important!</strong>

Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference.

Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year – so it’s important to take the time to compare. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans based on all of these factors, so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: It’s good to shop around</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. With the internet, we also have a wealth of information online to help us shop around. Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different.

We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. But you still need to make smart choices to get good value that meets your own health care needs. There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage. With all these choices, you may have questions like: How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year? If you’re currently in a plan, how does that plan stack up to the other plans that are available?

Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan? Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a>.

Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs. After you’ve narrowed your options, you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.

Whether it’s groceries, health insurance, or anything else, you want value for your dollar. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information that’s available.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Focusing on comfort &amp; support: hospice care</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Choosing to stop curative treatment is a scary moment for anyone. You worry about your family, the quality of the care you’ll receive, and keeping your dignity.

For over 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness.

Deciding you need Hospice care is a difficult choice to make, and it’s important to be informed about what Hospice covers. Here are a few of the services Hospice provides:
<ul>
	<li>Care is generally provided in the home.</li>
	<li>A specially trained team of professionals and caregivers provide care for the “whole person,” including your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs.</li>
	<li>Services typically include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related conditions.</li>
	<li>Family caregivers can get support.</li>
	<li>Once you choose hospice care, your hospice benefit should cover everything you need.</li>
</ul>
For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your state hospice organization.

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: Extra benefits &amp; peace of mind</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Going through the process of buying a car takes a bit of elbow grease, but when the salesman throws in free oil changes and scheduled maintenance, it’s worth it. Not only are you saving money, but there’s a peace of mind knowing that the support you’ll need is free.

Extra benefits and peace of mind can be a big plus in health coverage, too.

If you have Medicare, you get to enjoy extra benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">A discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/part-d-coverage-gap.html">coverage gap</a> (“donut hole”)</li>
	<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
Medicare also covers a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness exam</a> each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones. You can keep track of your preventive services and get reminders for them at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.

Also, most people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans, and many of these plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover like vision, hearing, dental coverage, prescription drugs, or extended coverage when you travel.

Just like deciding what car to buy, only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family. During Medicare Open Enrollment, decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Family caregivers provide an average of 20 hours of care per week – when you’re the caregiver, that can make it hard for you to care for yourself.

November is National Family Caregiver Month – a perfect opportunity to reach out for help if you’re caring for someone with Medicare. If you’re a caregiver, here are 4 things you can do this month to help <strong>you</strong> help your loved one:
<ol>
	<li>Check out our <a href="http://medicare.gov/campaigns/caregiver/caregiver.html">caregiver resources. </a></li>
	<li>Make sure your loved one’s Medicare coverage still meets their needs. Medicare Open Enrollment is from now until December 7, and it’s important to take a few minutes to <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/10/15/medicare-open-enrollment-are-you-ready-to-pick-a-plan/">review coverage and pick a plan that works for your loved one</a>.</li>
	<li>Find resources near you by visiting the Administration on Aging’s <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/">Eldercare Locator</a>.</li>
</ol>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: the value of convenience</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever bought milk from the convenience store just around the corner even though it’s a bit more expensive than buying it at the grocery store? Most of us have made decisions to do or not do something based on convenience.

The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. In addition to cost, coverage, and benefits, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:

<strong>Doctor and hospital choice</strong>

You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?

<strong>Pharmacy access</strong>

Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network? Do they <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">e-prescribe</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, check to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.

<strong>Travel</strong>

Do you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state? If so, see if your coverage will travel with you.

<strong>Quality</strong>

Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/when-can-i-join-a-health-or-drug-plan/five-star-enrollment/5-star-enrollment-period.html">Look for plans with a 5‑star performance</a> rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.

Your time is valuable — and so is your health. Only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.

We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer? Or, have you put off filling a prescription because you’re having trouble making ends meet? If so, we can help. Medicare has a special program called “<a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a>.” If you have limited income and resources, you can sign up to get help paying things like your monthly premium, annual deductible, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan. In 2015, drug costs for most people who qualify will be no more than $2.65 for each generic drug and $6.60 for each brand-name drug.

Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see. Many people with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of them?

It’s easy and free to apply for Extra Help. Here's how:
<ul>
	<li>Apply <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp">online</a>.</li>
	<li>Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users should call 1‑800‑325‑0778.</li>
	<li>Apply at your <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp">local Social Security office</a>.</li>
</ul>
Don’t wait - apply today to see if you qualify for some extra help with your health costs.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Prescription drug plan premiums: make it automatic</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/11/19/prescription-drug-plan-premiums-make-it-automatic/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[We like when things are automatic. From smart phone reminders to automatic coffee makers – it’s nice when something’s done before we even need to think about doing it. Whether you’ve already picked a new plan for 2015, or decided to keep the plan you had in 2014, one thing you might not have thought about is paying the monthly premium.

Most Medicare drug plans charge a monthly premium that varies by plan. You pay this in addition to your Medicare Part B premium. It’s important to pay this premium on time to keep your coverage and the peace of mind that comes with it.

Did you know that you can have this premium automatically deducted from your monthly Social Security payment? All you need to do is contact your Medicare drug plan (not Social Security). Your first deduction will usually take 3 months to start, and 3 months of premiums will likely be deducted at once. After that, only one premium will be deducted each month. You may also see a delay in premiums being withheld if you switch plans. If you want to stop premium deductions and get billed directly, just let your plan know.

Take the worry and guesswork out of when to pay your premium bills - contact your plan today.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Medicare Open Enrollment: is Medicare still on your “to do” list?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[“To do” lists are very helpful during this hectic time of year. If something important isn’t written down, it’s easy to forget. If you still haven’t crossed off “Compare Medicare coverage” from your to do list, time is running out!

Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.

In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a moment to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. If you decide you’re happy with the plan you have now, and the plan’s still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act so you can cross another item off your to do list.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Get your Medicare ready for 2015</title>
  <link>http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/12/08/get-ready/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you make resolutions for the new year? Here are some easy ones you can keep that will help get you ready for 2015:

<strong>1. Check to see that you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2015.</strong> Did you change your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment? If you did and you haven’t received your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</a>.

If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.

<strong>2. Budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible.</strong>

Remember, if you have Medicare Part B and you’re in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2014. Plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2015.</a>

<strong>3.  Schedule appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings.</strong>

Medicare covers all sorts of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems, and many are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.

Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.

4. <strong>Make sure your drug or health plan meet your needs.</strong>

If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.

Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.

You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.

Remember to check <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.medicare.gov</a> for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a happy and healthy new year!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know that every year 50,000 people are diagnosed with HIV? Of the 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States, 1 in every 6 doesn’t even know they have it. December 1<sup>st</sup> 2014 is World AIDS day and the theme is “Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-free Generation.”

HIV is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.

What can you do to help achieve an AIDS-free generation? Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (like gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).

Visit Aids.gov to learn more about <a href="http://aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/world-aids-day/">World AIDS Day</a> and CDC.gov to learn more about their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ActAgainstAIDS/">Act Against AIDS campaign</a>.

To find an HIV test site, visit HIVtest.cdc.gov or text your zip code to “KNOWIT” (566948).]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know all women are at risk for cervical cancer, and it occurs most often in women over 30? Fortunately, Medicare covers 2 types of screening test – the Pap smear and human papilloma virus (HPV) test – that can help find cancer and other health problems early and improve recovery and survival rates.

January is Cervical Health Awareness Month. Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBtnj3N3IMs">Cervical Health Awareness Month video</a> and visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cervical-vaginal-cancer-screenings.html">cervical &amp; vaginal cancer screenings</a> page to learn what these tests do and how often they’re covered.

  <title>Choosing a dialysis facility just got easier</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you the kind of shopper who reads reviews or looks at ratings before you make a purchase? Wouldn’t it be helpful to have the same kind of ratings when choosing a dialysis facility?

It can be overwhelming when you’re faced with having to choose a health care provider. Providers and facilities differ in the safety and quality of care they give, and having quality ratings available to compare providers can help you make more informed health care decisions. That’s why we’ve made it easier to use the information on our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/#search">Dialysis Facility Compare</a> (DFC) site by adding star ratings.

Compare websites are the official source for information about the quality of health care providers, and star ratings are just one of many ways we’re working to make quality information easier to understand and compare. These ratings are based on an established and respected process for developing standards. The DFC rating gives a 1 to 5-star rating based on information about the quality of care and services that a dialysis facility provides. Right now, we do this based on 9 quality measures.

The DFC ratings are just one example of how we’re commited to helping you make informed health care decisions. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html">Nursing Home Compare</a> site already uses star ratings to help consumers compare nursing homes and choose one based on quality. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/search.html">Physician Compare</a> has just started to include star ratings in certain situations for physician group practices. We’re planning on adding star ratings to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html">Hospital Compare</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.html">Home Health Compare</a> later this year.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>This Valentine’s Day, give yourself the gift of a healthy heart</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/">heart disease</a> can. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, taking 600,000 lives each year.

You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease. Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.

Medicare will cover a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">cardiovascular screening</a> at no cost to you every 5 years. The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.

If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions. You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy.

February is American Heart month, so start it off right by visiting the <a href="http://recipes.millionhearts.hhs.gov/">Million Hearts® Healthy Eating &amp; Lifestyle Resource Center</a>. Million Hearts is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. The resource center was developed in partnership with <em>EatingWell </em>magazine. It features lower sodium, heart-healthy recipes and family-friendly meal plans to help manage sodium intake, a major contributor to high blood pressure and heart disease.

Check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjMfwA4ToVE">video</a> for more information about the Million Hearts initiative.
