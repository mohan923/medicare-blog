      <p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:Arial;">heart disease</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> can.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease.  Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Medicare will cover a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html"><span style="font-family:Arial;">cardiovascular screening</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> at no cost to you every 5 years.  The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions.  You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Luckily, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. The national </span><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Million Hearts</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> campaign</span> <span style="font-family:Arial;">has pledged to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. You can join them, and get information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">February is </span><a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">American Heart Month</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">, and a healthy heart is the best Valentine’s Day gift you could ever give yourself, or the people who love you.</span></p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>The new year is fast approaching. Here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2014.</p>
<p><b>1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2014?</b><br />
If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment and don’t get your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</a>.</p>
<p>If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.</p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">2. Did you budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</b></p>
<p>Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2013. Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2014.</a></p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</b></p>
<p>Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</b></p>
<p>If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</span></p>
<p>You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.</p>

      <p>It feels like “to do” lists are everywhere these days – on a pad of paper on the kitchen table, in email, or in an app on a smart phone.  If you still have “Review Medicare coverage” on your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>Remember, the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act and cross another item off your to do list.</p>
