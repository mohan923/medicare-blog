    <p>Have you ever pumped gas into your car from a station just around the corner from home even though it’s a bit more expensive than the one in town? Most of us have made decisions to do or not do something based on convenience.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to cost, coverage, and benefits, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:</p>
<p><b>Doctor and hospital choice</b></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?</p>
<p><b>Pharmacy access</b></p>
<p>Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network?  Do they use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">e-prescribing</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.</p>
<p><b>Travel</b></p>
<p>Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p><b>Quality</b></p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/when-can-i-join-a-health-or-drug-plan/five-star-enrollment/5-star-enrollment-period.html">Look for plans with a 5‑star performance</a> rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.</p>
<p>Your time is valuable — and so is your health. Only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.</p>
