      <p>Reminders to take care of your physical health are all around you– on the web, in television ads, and from concerned family members. What you may not remember is that taking care of your mental health is just as important! May is National Mental Health Month, so we’re making an effort to spread the word about all of the mental health resources available to people with Medicare.</p>
<p>Medicare helps cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/outpatient-mental-health-care.html">outpatient</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/inpatient-mental-health-care.html">inpatient</a> mental health care, as well as <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/partial-hospitalization-mental-health-care.html">partial hospitalization</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/depression-screenings.html">screenings for depression</a>. If you have Medicare prescription drug coverage, you can also get medications to help treat a mental health condition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealth.gov/">Mental health</a> includes your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. If you experience mental health problems your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.</p>
<p>- Mental health problems are common and can be caused by many factors:</p>
<p>- Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</p>
<p>- Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</p>
<p>- Family history of mental health problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember: </strong> taking care of your health is about more than just your physical health – it’s about taking care of all of you! Medicare is here to help you take care of your mental health, and remind you that <strong>you’re not alone</strong> -- we’re here to support you.</p>

      <header class="entry-header"><!-- .entry-header -->Did you know that 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic Hepatitis B, but many more people don’t know they’re infected because they have no symptoms? Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</header>
<div class="entry-content post_content">
<p>Medicare can help keep you protected from Hepatitis B. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete coverage. If you’re at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B, Medicare Part B will cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a> for free.</p>
<p>Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? If you have hemophilia, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</a>, diabetes, or certain conditions that lower your resistance to infection, you have a higher risk for getting Hepatitis B increases. Additionally, if you have a profession that puts you in frequent contact with blood or bodily fluids, you may be at a higher risk.</p>
<p>May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>

      <p>Do you have a minute to keep your heart and kidneys healthy?  Getting a fast (less than a minute) and simple test can tell you if your blood pressure is too high.  High blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms, but it can lead to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.  Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy because it’s covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness </a> visits at no cost to you.</p>
<p>If you have high blood pressure, you can control it with lifestyle changes and medicine.  You may be at risk for high blood pressure if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoke</li>
<li>Eat salty foods</li>
<li>Don’t exercise enough</li>
<li>Drink more than a moderate amount of alcohol</li>
<li>Have a family history of high blood pressure</li>
<li>Are overweight</li>
</ul>
<p>May is National High Blood Pressure Awareness Month, so get tested and keep your heart and kidneys healthy!</p>

      <p> “Risky drinking” is defined as more than 21 drinks per month according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Geriatrics Society. Did you know that 9% of people with Medicare drink more than 30 drinks a month?</p>
<p>There are lots of changes that happen with age, and some of them, like physical pain, loss of mobility, and loneliness can lead to alcohol misuse.  Drinking too much alcohol increases your risk of injuries, violence, drowning, liver disease, bad interactions with medications, and some types of cancer. </p>
<p>April is Alcohol Awareness Month, and it’s the perfect time to remind you that Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/alcohol-counseling.html">alcohol misuse screening &amp; counselling</a> to provide counselling for people who misuse alcohol.</p>
