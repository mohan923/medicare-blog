      <p><em>By Julie Green Bataille, Director of Communications </em></p>
<p>Whether it’s apple picking or Sunday afternoon football, there’s a comfort in things that happen every fall. Shorter days and cooler nights also mark the start of Medicare Open Enrollment. Between now and December 7, you can expect to hear about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">choices, benefits, and lower overall costs</a> you have when it comes to Medicare - many of them thanks to the health care law.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you are happy sticking with the plan you have.  The health care law extended the Open Enrollment period and made it earlier – giving you more time to make choices and giving Medicare time to process everything so your coverage starts without a hitch on January 1<sup>st</sup>.This year, you can make any changes as early as October 15.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits.  Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Medicare Open Enrollment calendar</a> tells you what to look for this fall, especially in these 4 everyday places:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your mailbox<br />
</strong>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any extra help you may get paying for prescription drugs.Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">Medicare &amp; You</a> handbook.  Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. This year, it may be in your email inbox instead – if you decide to “go green” and asked to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Library/PDFNavigation/PDFInterim.asp?Language=English&amp;Type=Pub&amp;PubID=10050">get it electronically</a>. But whether it’s on your computer or on your bookshelf, now is the time to take it out and find out what’s new in Medicare.</p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from <strong>you</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>On your computer<br />
</strong>Comparing your plan choices is important –and our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it as simple as possible. Soon, you’ll be able to watch a video about how the Plan Finder works. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review a the plan’s <a href="http://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">star ratings</a> to compare plans based on quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs.</li>
<li><strong>In newspaper, newsletters, and magazines<br />
</strong>Take a moment as you enjoy that morning coffee to read the Medicare information that’s out there.  You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it.</li>
<li><strong>On television and radio<br />
</strong>At the end of one of those shorter days, as you relax in front of the television, you may see some advertisements or programming about Medicare plans and your new choices.  You might also hear some advertisements on your way to or from work as you listen to the radio.Now is the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.</li>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em></p>
<p>With the start of this year’s Medicare Open Enrollment less than two weeks away, I can’t stress one point enough: Medicare is stronger than ever. Consumers have more and better Medicare options than ever before.</p>
<p>Seniors this year can expect more choices, more benefits, and lower overall costs. </p>
<p>Because it’s a fact:  99% of you have at least one Medicare Advantage plan in your area. And everyone with Medicare can get a host of preventive tests and screenings —more than ever before — at absolutely no cost to you.  Medicare also continues to cover an Annual Wellness Visit – a great chance to talk with your doctor or other health provider about treating small problems and concerns before they become big ones.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part: even with these improved benefits, people won’t be feeling it in their pocketbooks.  Average premiums for Part D drug coverage are holding steady in 2012, and premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are actually <em>dropping</em> an average of 4%. And people who reach the Part D coverage gap will get a 50% discount on brand name drugs. </p>
<p>This is all great news for the 47 million American seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare.</p>
<p>We know that more choices can make decisions challenging, but we’ve expanded the Medicare safety net to make sure folks can get the help they need to sift through their options.  You can even get an early start — we’ve already made sure the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is fully updated with all new 2012 cost and benefit information for health and drug plans.  If you’re the kind of person who likes to get online yourself and sort through the details, you can use this online tool right now.  Start by entering your drugs and checking on the doctors and pharmacies you want to use.  A few steps will get you to a personalized list of your plan choices and help you compare.   </p>
<p>If you’d rather get a personal hand walking through your choices, we’ve got help for you, too. You can call or visit one of the thousands of wonderful volunteers staffing the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs across the country. </p>
<p>One more way we’re going to help – every week during Open Enrollment, we’re going to have some of our top health care experts adding tips and advice to this blog, to give you some important things to consider as you weigh your choices.  When Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7, we want every single American with Medicare to have health and drug coverage that meets their needs.   Are you ready?</p>

      <p><span style="font-size:small;">Have you had your mammogram this year? Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it's the most treatable. </span><span style="font-size:small;">All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months - and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/breast-cancer-screening.aspx">Medicare covers it for free</a></span> if your doctor accepts assignment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening.  Ask your family members and friends if they've had theirs - share the health. </span></p>
