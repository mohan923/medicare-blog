      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">When I’m getting ready to buy a new product, I will look for the clerk at the store and ask all kinds of questions.  However, when I see the doctor, I find that I don’t ask questions because I’m not sure what to ask, or I’m too embarrassed to ask. Let’s face it, many in our Hispanic community prefer to ask a coworker, friend or even a family member about health concerns or treatment advice rather than going to the doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Well, now there’s a  </span><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Spanish Web site</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that can help us ask the right questions and can improve communication with our doctors. </span><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Conozca las preguntas</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> (Know the questions. Questions, answers and health tips for the Hispanic community) offers tips and sample questions to help you prepare for your medical appointments.

<p><em>By Donald M. Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Cross posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Seniors06282011a.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>

<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, almost half a million individuals enrolled in Medicare’s prescription drug benefit have received a 50 percent discount on their out-of-pocket costs in the first five months of 2011.</p>
<p>Because of Medicare improvements in the Affordable Care Act, beneficiaries now automatically receive a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs in the Part D coverage gap, or <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">“donut hole,”</a> and have saved more than $260 million so far this year.</p>
<p>In May alone, we have seen a 76 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries receiving this discount (478,272 individuals through the end of May <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/seniors05242011.html">compared to</a> 270,900 through the end of April). In addition, the total savings these beneficiaries received grew over 56 percent in one month, for a total average savings of $545 per beneficiary (<a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/donuthole06282011a.html">for state-by-state figures, please click here</a>).</p>
<p>Most of these discounts are helping Americans with serious medical conditions – nearly 14 percent of the benefits provided to date – more than $36 million – are for cancer drugs, more than 8 percent or $21 million for drugs to help control high blood pressure and cholesterol, and another more than 7 percent – about $20 million – are for drugs provides to diabetic patients.</p>
<p>As more and more beneficiaries hit the donut hole through the rest of this year, the numbers will continue to climb. All of these beneficiaries will see savings on their drug costs that were not available in previous years.</p>
<p>And cheaper prescriptions are just one of the many ways the Affordable Care Act is improving Medicare for seniors. Thanks to the new law, many preventive care screenings are available free of charge. As of June 10, we found that about 5.5 million people with Medicare have accessed one or more preventive measures and last week, we launched a new awareness effort– <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/prevention06202011a.html"><em>Share the News, Share the Health</em></a> – to highlight Medicare’s preventive benefits and encourage Medicare beneficiaries taking advantage of these potentially lifesaving services.</p>
<p>More information on the free preventive services that are available to people on Medicare can be found on the “Manage Your Health” tab at <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.Medicare.gov</a>.</p>

<p>You have your grocery list. You have your “to-do” list. You even have a post-it note stuck to your steering wheel in your car reminding you to get your oil changed. We write things down to help us remember when life gets busy.  And when it comes to your health, there seem to be about a million things to remember. So why don’t you have a checklist dedicated to the care and keeping of you?</p>
<p>Take this <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-checklist.aspx">checklist</a> to your doctor or other health care provider to find out what preventive services are right for you. This comprehensive check-list spells out the Medicare covered preventive services and allows you to keep track of when you received a particular test, screening, or service, as well as when you are due for your next one. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, these preventive services ranging from mammograms and flu shots to a yearly “wellness” visit, are offered free of charge to patients covered by Medicare.</p>
<p> <a href="http://themedicareblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/062211blog-checklist.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-188" title="062211blog-checklist" src="assets/062211blog-checklist.gif" alt="" width="417" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>Be sure to visit <a href="https://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to continue tracking your preventive services. You can get a two-year calendar of the Medicare-covered tests and screenings you’re eligible for. You can even print a personalized report to take with you to your next doctor’s appointment.</p>
<p>To help spread the word about Medicare’s preventive benefits, we just launched the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">Share the News, Share the Health</a> campaign.  Help us spread the word by telling your friends and family with Medicare about the difference these preventive benefits can make.</p>
<p>So don’t forget to pick up your milk and bread at the grocery store, and build time in to your busy schedule to get your oil changed. But also make sure you have your preventive services checklist updated and ready for your next doctor’s appointment. That way, you will know the right questions to ask your doctor to guarantee you are receiving the preventive services you need.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em></p>
<p>“Prevention” is a word we use a lot in health care – June is “National Prevention and Wellness Month” – but I want to take a minute to think about what it really means.</p>
<p>Intuitively, prevention makes sense: as the saying goes, you can either pay now or you can pay later. But oddly enough, our health care system often doesn’t reflect this fundamental mindset. Most health care focuses on treating disease. Prevention, on the other hand, focuses on health.</p>
<p>Preventive care is also patient-centered care, as people become active participants in maintaining their health and get services customized for their individual needs and preferences.</p>
<p>We know that prevention works. The Affordable Care Act provides new ways to help patients stay healthy and makes <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/medicare/preventiveservices.html">access to preventive services easier</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="http://downloads.cms.gov/files/preventionreport.pdf">released a new report</a> showing that more than 5 million Americans with traditional Medicare, or nearly one in six people with Medicare, took advantage of one or more of the recommended preventive benefits now available for free thanks to the Affordable Care Act – most prominently, mammograms, bone density screenings, and screenings for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the preventive services available to people on Medicare. Earlier this year, Medicare eliminated the Part B deductible and copayments for a host of preventive services, including bone mass measurement, some cancer screenings, diabetes and cholesterol tests, and flu, pneumonia, and hepatitis B shots.</p>
<p>We’ve also eliminated out-of-pocket costs for the “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit and, for the first time since the Medicare program was created in 1965, Medicare now covers an annual wellness visit with a participating doctor, also at no cost.</p>
<p>We’ve added expanded prescription drug benefits to the preventive arsenal as well. This year, people with Medicare started to benefit from a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">50% percent discount on covered brand name drugs</a> bought when they’re in the donut hole, and we’ll continue to chip away at the donut hole until it’s closed in 2020. Making prescription drugs more affordable increases the chance they’ll be taken as needed. Again – prevention just makes sense.</p>
<p>Find out which preventive services are right for you by taking <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-checklist.aspx">this checklist</a> to your doctor or other health care provider.</p>
<p>Our job now is to ensure that everyone eligible for Medicare uses these benefits. We need to encourage every person with Medicare, every caregiver, every physician to join our nationwide campaign for prevention. We are calling our campaign, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html"><strong><em>Share the News, Share the Health</em></strong></a>, which will run throughout the summer, with online ads and community events all over the country starting in July.</p>
<p>Focusing on prevention doesn’t just improve care – it’s also an important step in reducing the cost of health care. The financial costs of treating chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes are enormous. Add in the intangible costs of pain and suffering, and the very real economic costs of lost productivity, and the opportunity costs of chronic illness are simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>This is why we’re also working closely to incorporate best practices from the Centers for Disease Control, particularly around ways to reduce cardiovascular mortality. This type of collaboration is critical to moving us towards a prevention-based model of care.</p>
<p>Focusing on prevention also makes sense when we value treating the whole patient – not just a condition or disease. When we help people take better care of their health, everyone in the community benefits. If we wait to pay for care as illness progresses, the price of health care for the country will continue to rise.</p>
<p>Prevention just makes sense.</p>
