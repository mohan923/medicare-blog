      <p>Got your passport? Check. Change of clothes? Check. Trip insurance? Check. Additional health care coverage? What?</p>
<p>You take time checking into airfare, hotels, and sightseeing adventures, so why not make sure you know what your health care covers when you go on vacation?  This is especially important if you’re traveling outside the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/o.html#original-medicare">Original Medicare</a> generally doesn’t cover care you get abroad—however, you <em>are</em> covered if you visit Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, as they’re considered part of the U.S.</p>
<p>If you take a cruise, you may be covered by Medicare if the ship's doctor is allowed to provide medical services under certain laws and the ship is closer than 6 hours away from a U.S. port. Medicare won’t cover services you get if your ship is further away than 6 hours from a U.S. port.</p>
<p>In rare cases, Medicare will pay for inpatient hospital services you get in Canada or Mexico. For example, you may be covered if you’re in the U.S. when a medical emergency happens and a Canadian or Mexican hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat the emergency.</p>
<p>Visit "<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11037.pdf">Medicare Coverage Outside the United States</a>” for more details on what Medicare covers when you’re on a cruise or out of the country.</p>
<p>Also, keep healthy by being aware of local health conditions at your destination. The Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health Web page</a> has health information for travel to more than 200 international destinations. <em>Bon Voyage</em>!</p>

      <p>Medicare has always covered preventive services to keep you healthy, and you already know how important they are. But did you know that your family and friends can also take advantage of them–even if they don’t have Medicare?</p>
<p>Under the health care law, many insurance companies must cover free preventive health services like yearly wellness visits, immunizations, some cancer screenings, and more. Your loved ones won’t have to pay a copayment or coinsurance, or meet a deductible, as long as they get these services from a provider in their plan’s network.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of these benefits is an easy and important way for your family and friends to stay healthy. Preventive benefits can keep them from getting certain diseases, or can help them find health problems early, when treatment works best.</p>
<p>Better health is in your hands–but not just <em>your</em> health. Talk with your friends and family so they can <span style="color:#000000;">join the millions of Americans who are already using these benefits. By spreading the word today, you can help keep them healthy for all those tomorrows you want to enjoy. </span></p>
<p>Need more information?</p>
<ul>
<li>         Review a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention">full listing</a> of covered preventive services for women, adults, and children.</li>
<li>         Talk to your doctor to see which preventive services are right for you.</li>

      <p><em>Written By: Ingrid Donato, Mental Health Promotion Branch Chief, Center for Mental Health Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://blog.samhsa.gov/2012/06/27/how-we-can-stop-older-americans-from-being-bullied/">SAMHSA Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Bullying-like aggression can happen to people of all ages – including older Americans. One has to look no further than the situation of Karen Klein, the 68-year-old monitor of Bus 784 in Greece, NY who was tormented by adolescents in a school bus.</p>
<p>Although bullying is typically defined as occurring among youth, what happened on this bus shows that this type of aggression can happen to anyone.  For older adults these problems can occur in many settings, including their homes and long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or assisted living residencesllying can come at the hands of many people in direct contact with elders, including caregivers, family, or even facility residents.</p>
<p>One of the most painful forms of bullying is isolation.</p>
<p>As hard as it is to spot, and sometimes accept, offenders may include family members and old friends, newly developed “friends” who intentionally prey on older adults, and service providers in positions of trust.</p>
<p>While there is no typical profile of an abuser, the following are some behavioral signs that may indicate problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abusing alcohol or other drugs</li>
<li>Controlling elder’s actions: whom they see and talk to, where they go</li>
<li>Isolating elders from family and friends, which can increase dependence</li>
<li>Emotional/ financial dependency on elder; inability to be self‐sufficient</li>
<li>Threatening to leave or send elder to a nursing home</li>
<li>Appearing to be indifferent to the child or elder; seeming apathetic or hostile</li>
<li>Minimizing an elder’s injuries, blaming victim or others for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation</li>
<li>Threatening to harm a victim’s pet</li>
<li>Calling the elder and or young person names</li>
<li>Previous criminal history</li>
<li>Longstanding personality traits (bad temper, hypercritical, tendency to blame others for problems)</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking time to <a href="http://store.samhsa.gov/product/15-Make-Time-To-Listen-Take-Time-To-Talk-About-Bullying/SMA08-4321">listen</a> and to really “hear” people–of any age—are the first lines of defense against <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/index.html">bullying</a>.  Looking for these signs and carefully talking with the older people in your life can be an important first step in determining whether or not there is a problem.  If you know someone who is being bullied or is a victim of aggressive behavior, there are steps you can take to get the bullying to stop – and the information is available at: <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html">http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>If you suspect elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation, visit the <a href="http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/NCEAroot/Main_Site/Find_Help/State_Resources.aspx">National Center on Elder Abuse</a> to find phone numbers for your state, or call the Eldercare Locator at <strong>1-800-677-1116.</strong>  If someone is in immediate danger, <strong>call 911 or the local police</strong>.</p>
<p>Through communication and action, older Americans and people of all ages can free themselves of the risks, torment and trauma of events like what happened on Bus 784.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Did you know that more than 1 million Americans are living with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, yet approximately 1 in 5 of them don't know it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Have you been tested? Medicare covers </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hiv-screening.aspx">HIV screening</a><span style="color:#000000;"> once every 12 months, or up to 3 times during a pregnancy, for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners). You pay nothing for the tests, but you generally have to pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the doctor visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Early testing and diagnosis is key to prevention. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Early testing cuts the spread of disease, extends life expectancy, and cuts costs of care. Testing is an important first step in bringing people with HIV infection the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">June 27 is National HIV Testing Day. Make sure your loved ones have been tested—the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime. You can learn more about HIV testing and what you can do to increase testing awareness by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HIVtesting/">Centers for Disease Control</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

      <p>Do you or a loved one have cataracts?  A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens that affects vision. According to the National Eye Institute, by age 80, more than half of all Americans will either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.</p>
<p>Medicare can help. Medicare Part B covers cataract surgery, and after surgery Medicare helps pay for cataract glasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lenses you get from an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Cataracts often come with age—they affect the vision of about half of all people between 65 and 74. Your risk for cataracts also may increase through long term exposure to sunlight, if you have diabetes, or if you smoke. New eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses may help your symptoms. If not, you may need surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.</p>
<p>June is Cataract Awareness Month. Visit the <a href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/">National Eye Institute</a> at the National Institutes of Health to learn more about cataracts.</p>
