      <p><i><span style="color:#000000;">By: Marilyn Tavenner, Acting CMS Administrator </span></i></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We’re now past the halfway point for Medicare’s annual Open Enrollment period, which opened on October 15 and closes December 7. As you and your loved ones with Medicare sit down to consider your options for 2013, we’d like to share the latest news about Medicare.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Our Administration is committed to making Medicare stronger for you and future generations. Thanks to the health care law, everyone on Medicare can get preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings for free. The health care law also makes prescription drugs more affordable for seniors who hit the donut hole. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">These new benefits are making a difference for millions of Americans. 5.6 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved $4.8 billion on prescription drugs since the law was enacted, and during the first nine months of 2012 over 20.7 million people with original Medicare got at least one preventive service at no cost to them.</span> </p>
<p>These and other parts of the law will result in significant savings. We estimate that the health care law will <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/beneficiarysavings/ib.shtml">save the average person in traditional Medicare $5,000 through 2022</a>.  <span style="color:#000000;">Earlier this year we projected that the standard premium for Medicare Part B (which covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services) would rise by more than $9.00 a month in 2013. Today we announce</span><span style="color:#000000;">d that the actual rise will be lower—$5.00—bringing 2013 Part B premiums to $104.90 a month. By law, the premium must cover a percent of Medicare’s expenses; premium increases are in line with projected cost increases.  Medicare Part B premiums have gone up slowly over the past five years – an average of less than 2 percent a year, or $8.50 total.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Several other changes in 2013 include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Premium:</b> Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care. Only about 1 percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services—you need to have paid Medicare payroll taxes for 40 quarters of employment or be married to someone who did. For those few affected, the 2013 Part A premium is decreasing to $441, down from $451 in 2012.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Deductible: </b>This deductible is the cost to people with Medicare for up to 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient services in the hospitals for each benefit period (a benefit period starts the day a patient is admitted and ends when the patient has been out of the hospital for 60 days in a row.)  This will increase to $1,184 in 2013, up from $1156 this year (an increase of 2.4%).</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part B Deductible:</b> The deductible will increase to $147 in 2013, from $140. This is still $15 below the deductible in 2011. </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Income-related Adjustments:</b> People with Medicare who report 2011income above $85,000 a year ($170,000 filing jointly) are legally responsible to cover a larger portion of the cost of their coverage.  These premium adjustments range from $42.00 to $230.80 a month for Medicare Part B.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As Open Enrollment finishes up and we approach a new year, people with Medicare can be assured they are part of a program that strives to deliver better benefits while curbing costs. And we will continue to do all we can to make Medicare even stronger.</span></p>

      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</em></p>
<p>In this season of Open Enrollment, people with Medicare have the opportunity to choose the Medicare plan that best serves their unique health needs and provides them with the greatest value. In determining the value of a plan choice, you should look not only at premiums and cost-sharing but also at what benefits and quality of care that money will buy. This year, I am proud to say that while costs, by and large, have remained relatively stable, the benefits that people with Medicare will get for their premiums continues to grow.</p>
<p>For those choosing Original Medicare, the benefit package continues to grow stronger and provide greater value. For example, EVERYONE with Medicare has access to a variety of preventive services and screenings, most at no cost to them when furnished by qualified and participating health care professionals. This includes things like diabetes and cancer screenings, and a yearly “wellness” visit. During the first 9 months of this year, over 20 million people with Original Medicare received at least one preventive service at no cost.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries may also explore their options beyond Original Medicare, as virtually all people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans in 2013, and many of these plans offer extra benefits beyond the comprehensive package offered by Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans may offer vision, hearing, or dental coverage, or extend coverage while you travel. And most Medicare Advantage Plans also include prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p>Use this time to decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the Medicare Plan Finder to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area for what will provide you with the greatest value. If you still need help comparing, call 1 800 MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</p>
<p>Only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you. Just know that no matter how you choose to get your Medicare benefits, you’ll be getting more.</p>

      <p><i>By: Patrick Conway, M.D., Director and Chief Medical Officer, CMS Center for Clinical Standards and Quality</i></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html"><span style="color:#800080;">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won't work for you?</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotic resistance, caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. These drug-resistant bacteria—which were once easily treatable—can now cause significant harm and suffering. When antibiotics fail to work, we get longer-lasting illnesses, need more doctor visits or extended hospital stays, and more expensive medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you or a loved one lives in a nursing home, pay close attention to when antibiotics are prescribed. Roughly  2 out of 3 nursing home residents get at least one course of antibiotics each year, yet nearly 27,000 residents end up with antibiotic-resistant infections each year. These infections are often severe, difficult to treat, and lead to more hospitalizations and deaths among people over 65.  If you have questions, please ask your health care provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The CDC has marked November 12—18 as </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">. You can take several steps to make certain you’re using antibiotics properly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you. </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later. </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Not sure if you have a virus, which can’t be treated by antibiotics? </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/campaign-materials/print-materials/VirusBacteriaChart-bw.pdf">Get smart—read this chart!</a><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><span style="color:#800080;">flu shot</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</span></p>
