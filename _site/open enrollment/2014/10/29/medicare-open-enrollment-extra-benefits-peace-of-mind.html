    <p>Going through the process of buying a car takes a bit of elbow grease, but when the salesman throws in free oil changes and scheduled maintenance, it’s worth it. Not only are you saving money, but there’s a peace of mind knowing that the support you’ll need is free.</p>
<p>Extra benefits and peace of mind can be a big plus in health coverage, too.</p>
<p>If you have Medicare, you get to enjoy extra benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">A discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/part-d-coverage-gap.html">coverage gap</a> (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare also covers a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness exam</a> each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones. You can keep track of your preventive services and get reminders for them at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Also, most people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans, and many of these plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover like vision, hearing, dental coverage, prescription drugs, or extended coverage when you travel.</p>
<p>Just like deciding what car to buy, only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family. During Medicare Open Enrollment, decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.</p>
