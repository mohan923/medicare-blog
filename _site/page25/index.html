      <p>Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.</p>
<p>A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong></p>
<p>If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</li>
<li>Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)</li>
<li>Qualified Individual (QI) Program</li>
<li>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each program has a different monthly income limit – <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">get more information about the 2012 limits</a> and how to find out if you qualify.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Help</strong></p>
<p>Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy">Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>.</p>
<p>You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/i1020/start">apply for “Extra Help.”</a></p>
<p>Save money, live well, and share the information.</p>

      <p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></li>
<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</li>
<li>Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</li>
<li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</li>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">As part of National Consumer Protection Week, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Marilyn Tavenner, announced the redesign of the statement that informs Medicare beneficiaries about their claims for Medicare services and benefits.  The redesigned statement, known as the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), will be available online and, starting in 2013, mailed out quarterly to beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">This MSN redesign is part of a new initiative, “Your Medicare Information: Clearer, Simpler, At Your Fingertips,” which aims to make Medicare information clearer, more accessible, and easier for beneficiaries and their caregivers to understand.  CMS will take additional actions this year to make information about benefits, providers, and claims more accessible and easier to understand for seniors and people with disabilities who have Medicare.  This MSN redesign reflects more than 18 months of research and feedback from beneficiaries to provide enhanced customer service and respond to suggestions and input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">“Consumer protection starts with making sure consumers not only get timely and accurate information, but that they understand what services they’re receiving from Medicare,” said Acting Administrator Tavenner.  “The new Medicare Summary Notice empowers Medicare’s seniors and people with disabilities.  The statement is easier to understand and navigate, and makes clear what information to check and how to report potential fraud.  The new MSN also makes it easier for people with Medicare to understand their benefits and file appeals if a claim is denied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">To see a side-by-side comparison of the former and redesigned MSNs, please visit:</span> <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The redesign of the MSN includes several features not currently available to Medicare beneficiaries with the current MSN:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">A clear notice on how to check the form for important facts and potential fraud;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">An easy-to-understand snapshot of the beneficiary’s deductible status, a list of providers they saw, and whether their claims for Medicare services were approved.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Clearer language, including consumer-friendly descriptions for medical procedures;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Definitions of all terms used in the form;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Larger fonts throughout to make it easier to read;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Information on preventive services available to Medicare beneficiaries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Starting later this week, the redesigned MSN will be available to beneficiaries on mymedicare.gov, Medicare’s secure online service for personalized information regarding Medicare benefits and services; and, in early 2013, paper copies of the redesigned MSN will start to replace the current version being mailed.</span></p>

<p>Each day, you make decisions about your finances, health, privacy, and more. It’s important to protect yourself and make the best choices for you, especially when it comes to your Medicare.</p>
<p>During National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW), non-profit organizations and government agencies give people like you information on how to take advantage of your rights and make better-informed choices. At Medicare, we’re here to help you become an informed Medicare consumer. Here are 5 things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know your rights. </strong>As a person with Medicare, you have certain <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11534.pdf">rights and protections</a> designed to help protect you and make sure you get the health care services the law says you can get.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your identity.</strong> Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Keep the following personal information safe:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your Social Security number</li>
<li>Your Medicare number (or your membership card if you’re in a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan)</li>
<li>Your credit card and bank account numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Get more information on how to <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/preventfraud/index.html">protect yourself from identity theft</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help fight Medicare fraud.</strong> Medicare fraud diverts money from the Medicare program each year, which means higher health care costs for you. Learn how to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">spot and report fraud</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get involved with other seniors with the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP). </strong><a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">The SMP</a> educates and empowers people with Medicare to take an active role in detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Make informed Medicare choices. </strong>Each year during the fall Open Enrollment Period (October 15-December 7), review your plan to make sure it’s going to meet your needs for the following year. If you’re not satisfied with your current plan, you can switch during the Open Enrollment Period.<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.ncpw.gov/">NCPW</a> to learn more about the campaign, see which agencies and organizations are able to help you, and to find out if there are any NCPW activities happening in your area.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</em></p>
<p>Fighting fraud and waste in the health care system is a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/14/obama-administration-s-unprecedented-fraud-fighting-pays">top priority for the Obama Administration</a>.  We are committed to using all resources at our disposal in these efforts – and they are paying off.</p>
<p>Just last week, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/hcfac/index.asp">released an updated annual report</a> showing that in FY 2011 anti-fraud efforts have recovered more than $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare payments – the second year in a row recovery efforts reached this unprecedented level.  Compare this to just $2.14 billion recovered in FY 2008.  Prosecutions are way up too:  the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 821 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 – nearly a 75 percent increase.</p>
<p>But we know we need keep doing more to end the “pay and chase” model of fighting fraud.  We need to stop fraud and waste from happening in the first place.  Today we’re taking an important step to protect taxpayer dollars by reducing improper payments to Medicare Advantage plans, an action that is estimated to save $370 million in the first audit year alone.  By improving the way we audit Medicare Advantage contracts, we will reduce the payment error rate for the Medicare Advantage program  and that saves money for Medicare.</p>
<p>We are also using new, advanced techniques to fight fraud.  Starting last year, we have been using “predictive modeling” technology – similar to technology used by credit card companies to identify and fight fraud nationwide.  This effort is just getting started but it’s already making a difference. Since the predictive modeling system was activated, CMS has stopped, prevented or identified $20 million in payments through November 2011 that should not have been made.</p>
<p>In addition, predictive modeling has identified 2,500 leads for further investigation, 600 preliminary law enforcement cases under review and resulted in 400 direct interviews with providers who would not have otherwise been contacted.</p>
<p>Predictive modeling won’t reach its full potential in overnight, but it’s already making an incredible difference and will do even more in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>
