    <p>Reminders to take care of your physical health are all around you– on the web, in television ads, and from concerned family members. What you may not remember is that taking care of your mental health is just as important! May is National Mental Health Month, so we’re making an effort to spread the word about all of the mental health resources available to people with Medicare.</p>
<p>Medicare helps cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/outpatient-mental-health-care.html">outpatient</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/inpatient-mental-health-care.html">inpatient</a> mental health care, as well as <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/partial-hospitalization-mental-health-care.html">partial hospitalization</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/depression-screenings.html">screenings for depression</a>. If you have Medicare prescription drug coverage, you can also get medications to help treat a mental health condition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealth.gov/">Mental health</a> includes your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. If you experience mental health problems your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.</p>
<p>- Mental health problems are common and can be caused by many factors:</p>
<p>- Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</p>
<p>- Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</p>
<p>- Family history of mental health problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember: </strong> taking care of your health is about more than just your physical health – it’s about taking care of all of you! Medicare is here to help you take care of your mental health, and remind you that <strong>you’re not alone</strong> -- we’re here to support you.</p>
