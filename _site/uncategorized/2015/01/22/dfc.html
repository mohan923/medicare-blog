    <p>Are you the kind of shopper who reads reviews or looks at ratings before you make a purchase? Wouldn’t it be helpful to have the same kind of ratings when choosing a dialysis facility?</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming when you’re faced with having to choose a health care provider. Providers and facilities differ in the safety and quality of care they give, and having quality ratings available to compare providers can help you make more informed health care decisions. That’s why we’ve made it easier to use the information on our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/#search">Dialysis Facility Compare</a> (DFC) site by adding star ratings.</p>
<p>Compare websites are the official source for information about the quality of health care providers, and star ratings are just one of many ways we’re working to make quality information easier to understand and compare. These ratings are based on an established and respected process for developing standards. The DFC rating gives a 1 to 5-star rating based on information about the quality of care and services that a dialysis facility provides. Right now, we do this based on 9 quality measures.</p>
<p>The DFC ratings are just one example of how we’re commited to helping you make informed health care decisions. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html">Nursing Home Compare</a> site already uses star ratings to help consumers compare nursing homes and choose one based on quality. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/search.html">Physician Compare</a> has just started to include star ratings in certain situations for physician group practices. We’re planning on adding star ratings to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html">Hospital Compare</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.html">Home Health Compare</a> later this year.</p>
