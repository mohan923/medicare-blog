    <p>The onset of spring is a reminder of new beginnings - the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health.  One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Because preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, it’s a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>Your Preventive Services with Medicare</b></p>
<p>If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> preventive visit is now covered for free during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.</p>
<p>If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors.  In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colon cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">breast cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">osteoporosis</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">heart disease</a>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive care</a> to ensure you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.</p>
