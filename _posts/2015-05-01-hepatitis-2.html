<p>Did you know that hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by a virus, affects millions of people worldwide, resulting in acute and chronic liver disease and killing close to 1.4 million people every year?</p>
<p>Hepatitis is contagious. For example, the Hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also get infected by coming in contact with a contaminated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days. Hepatitis B can range from being a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long-term illness (chronic) that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</p>
<p>Medicare can help keep you protected from the most common types of hepatitis.</p>
<p>Generally, Medicare Part D (<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html">prescription drug coverage</a>) covers Hepatitis A shots when medically necessary.</p>
<p>Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a>, which usually are given as a series of 3 shots over a 6-month period (you need all 3 shots for complete protection).</p>
<p>There’s a third type of Hepatitis—Hepatitis C. Medicare covers a one-time <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-c-screening-test.html">Hepatitis C screening test</a> if your primary care doctor or practitioner orders it and you meet one of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re at high risk because you have a current or past history of illicit injection drug use</li>
<li>You had a blood transfusion before 1992, or</li>
<li>You were born between 1945 and 1965</li>
</ul>
<p>May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating hepatitis visit the <a href="http://www.CDC.gov/hepatitis/">Centers for Disease Control’s Hepatitis web page</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNX_mc7S5s">video</a>.</p>
