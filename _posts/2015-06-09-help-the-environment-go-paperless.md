June 5th is World Environment Day – a day for encouraging awareness and action for the environment that’s celebrated in over 100 countries worldwide.  How can you make your voice heard this year?  One great way is to sign up to get your “Medicare & You” handbook electronically.

If you have an eReader (like an iPad, Kindle Fire, Surface, or Galaxy Tab) you can download a free digital version of the Medicare & You handbook to your eReader and take it with you anywhere you go.

Don’t have an eReader? You can still sign up to get a paperless version in a few simple steps. We’ll send you an email in September when the new eHandbook is available. The email will explain that instead of getting a paper copy in your mailbox each October, you’ll get an email linking you to the online version of “Medicare & You.” This online version of the handbook contains all the same information as the printed version.

Even better, the handbook information on Medicare.gov is updated regularly, so you can be confident that you have the most up-to-date Medicare information!

Sign up today to get your Medicare & You information electronically, and you’ll be making a difference for the environment. What a great way to make your voice heard and celebrate World Environment Day.
